// PM2 process definition for StrikeEdge.
//
// FORK MODE, ONE INSTANCE — deliberately NOT cluster mode.
//
// The in-process reservation store is the AUTHORITATIVE tier for a single
// process: within one Node process it decides, synchronously and without a round
// trip, which underlying an execution owns. Run two workers in cluster mode and
// that in-process authority is no longer global — worker A and worker B each
// believe they own the underlying. What makes MORE than one worker safe is the
// DURABLE PostgreSQL reservation tier plus globally-unique owner ids
// (src/box/reservations/*), NOT PM2. We ship the simple, correct topology: one
// fork-mode process, so the in-process tier and the durable tier agree. If you
// ever scale to multiple workers, they MUST all share the same PostgreSQL and
// rely on the durable tier for cross-process safety — do that as a deliberate,
// tested change, not by flipping `exec_mode` to "cluster".
//
// NO SECRETS HERE. All configuration comes from the process environment / .env.
