# Backend ⇄ Frontend API Contract (`contract/`)

This directory is the **backend-owned, versioned source of truth** for the shape of
every HTTP/SSE response the frontend depends on. It exists to make a breaking
backend response-shape change **fail CI** instead of silently going stale.

## Why this exists

The frontend's contract tests used to rely on **manually captured JSON fixtures**
(`Strikedge_F tests/fixtures/*.json`). Those drift silently: the backend changes a
field, the frontend fixture keeps the old shape, and **both repos keep passing
independently** while production is broken. This contract closes that gap
mechanically:

- The backend **describes** its real response shapes here as JSON-Schema files.
- The backend's own `tests/contract/*.test.mjs` validate **real serialized
  responses** (off a real loopback HTTP server, or from the real serializer/engine
  functions) against these schemas — so a schema that lies about the API fails the
  backend build.
- The frontend **pins** this directory by **commit SHA + digest** (see below) and
  runs the *same* schemas against its decoders — so a backend shape change that the
  frontend has not adopted fails the frontend build.

## What is here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `version.json` | `{ contract_version, schemas_sha256 }`. The version the frontend pins. |
| `validate.mjs` | A **dependency-free** JSON-Schema (draft 2020-12 **subset**) validator. Returns a list of precise error paths; a schema using an **unsupported keyword is a LOUD error**, never a silent pass. |
| `digest.mjs` | Computes `schemas_sha256` deterministically over `schemas/**` **and** `protocol.json` (schemas sorted by filename, then `protocol.json` last, exact bytes). |
| `schemas/*.schema.json` | One schema per response shape. |
| `protocol.json` | **Machine-readable protocol constants that are not JSON-Schema shapes** but are still part of the versioned wire contract: `csrf_header` (the request header the SPA echoes the CSRF token in), `session_cookie_default` (the default `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` from `src/config.ts`), and `csrf_cookie_suffix` (appended to the session cookie name to form the readable CSRF cookie). **The backend owns these values; the frontend MUST read them from this file, never hardcode its own copies.** Covered by `digest.mjs`, so renaming the CSRF header changes `schemas_sha256` exactly as a schema edit would. |

No runtime dependency is added: the backend still ships only `express`, `pg`,
`mongodb`, `dotenv`. `validate.mjs` is a small, unit-tested subset validator
(`tests/contract/validator.test.mjs`).

### The validator subset

Supported keywords ONLY: `type` (incl. unions, which is how nullable is modelled),
`required`, `properties`, `additionalProperties`, `items`, `prefixItems`, `enum`,
`const`, `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `$ref` (to a sibling `*.schema.json`), `minimum`,
`maximum`, and `format: "date-time"` (shallow). Annotation keywords (`$schema`,
`$id`, `title`, `description`, `$comment`, `examples`, `default`, `deprecated`,
`readOnly`, `writeOnly`) are accepted and impose no obligation. **Anything else
throws** — a validator that silently skips a keyword is worse than none.

### Closed vs open shapes

Most shapes use `additionalProperties: false` so an **added** field is also caught,
not just a removed/renamed one. Where a shape is legitimately open (an engine-owned
diagnostic/audit sub-object whose internal fields are not part of the frontend
contract, e.g. `box-status.metrics`, `box-trade.entry_execution`), the property
carries a `$comment` explaining why it is open and the contract pins only its
**presence and JSON type**.

## Protocol constants (`protocol.json`) — the CSRF header is single-sourced here

`protocol.json` holds machine-readable protocol constants that are **not** response
shapes but are nonetheless part of the versioned contract:

| Key | Meaning | Backend source of truth |
|-----|---------|-------------------------|
| `csrf_header` | The request header the SPA must echo the CSRF token in. | `src/access/csrf.ts` `CSRF_HEADER` |
| `session_cookie_default` | The default `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`. | `src/config.ts` `loadAppConfig` default |
| `csrf_cookie_suffix` | Appended to the session cookie name to form the readable CSRF cookie. | `src/access/cookies.ts` `csrfCookieName` |

**Why this file exists.** The CSRF header name `x-csrf-token` used to be hardcoded
**independently** in the backend (`src/access/csrf.ts`) and the frontend
(`src/api/http.ts`), and each repo tested only its **own** literal. A one-sided
rename therefore passed its own CI while silently breaking authentication. Making
`protocol.json` the single source of truth — and covering it with the digest — closes
that gap: a rename now changes `schemas_sha256`, forcing the coordinated
version-bump procedure below.

- **Backend:** `tests/contract/protocolConstants.test.mjs` asserts `CSRF_HEADER` equals
  `protocol.json.csrf_header`, that `csrfCookieName()` equals
  `<sessionCookieName><csrf_cookie_suffix>`, and that the `src/config.ts` default
  session cookie name equals `session_cookie_default`. A rename on **either** side
  fails the backend contract suite.
- **Frontend (REQUIRED):** the frontend MUST **read the CSRF header name from the
  vendored `contract/protocol.json`** (the same digest-verified copy it pins for the
  schemas) and MUST NOT hardcode its own `"x-csrf-token"` literal. Reading from the
  contract is what makes a rename impossible to ship one-sided: the frontend would
  pick up the new name from the vendored contract, and the digest/version pin forces
  it to re-vendor deliberately.

## The coordinated cross-repo update procedure (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

When you change an API response shape, do this **in order**:

1. **Change the backend serializer / route.** Make the code change in `Strikedge_B`
   (`src/box/serialize.ts`, `src/box/engine.ts`, `src/runtime/statusRoutes.ts`,
   `src/brokerRoutes.ts`, `src/access/routes.ts`, `src/box/routes.ts`, …).
2. **Update the schema.** Edit the matching `contract/schemas/*.schema.json` so it
   describes the new shape (add/remove/rename fields, adjust types/enums).
3. **Bump `contract_version`.** In `contract/version.json`, increment
   `contract_version` (semver: patch for additive-optional, minor/major for
   anything the frontend must adapt to).
4. **Regenerate `schemas_sha256`.** Run `node contract/digest.mjs` and paste the hex
   into `contract/version.json`. (The backend test
   `digest: version.json schemas_sha256 MATCHES …` FAILS until you do this, so a
   schema edit without a version bump cannot ship.)
5. **Run the backend contract tests.**
   `npm run test:contract` — this validates the **real** new responses against the
   updated schemas and runs the negative controls. Fix until green.
6. **Copy `contract/` into the frontend and update the pinned SHA + digest.** In
   `Strikedge_F`, replace its vendored copy of this directory and update its pin to
   the **backend commit SHA** and the **`schemas_sha256`** from step 4.
7. **Run the frontend contract tests.** In `Strikedge_F`, run its contract suite so
   its decoders are checked against the new schemas. Fix the frontend until green.
8. **Merge order: backend FIRST, then frontend.** The backend change is what
   produces the new bytes; merging the frontend first would point it at a shape the
   deployed backend does not yet emit.

### The frontend pins a COMMIT SHA and a DIGEST — never an unpinned download

The frontend must vendor `contract/` at a specific **backend commit SHA** and
verify `schemas_sha256` against `version.json`. A normal frontend build therefore
**never depends on an unpinned, mutable fetch of `main`**: it reads the vendored,
digest-verified copy. Updating the contract is an explicit, reviewed step (6–7
above), not an implicit consequence of the backend moving.

## Schema inventory

Access: `access-verify`, `access-status`.
Runtime/export: `runtime-status` (+ `broker-runtime-status`), `export-status`.
Broker: `broker-status` (+ `broker-session`, `broker-health`),
`broker-switch-blockers`, `broker-select-success`, `broker-select-refusal`.
Box: `box-status`, `box-config`, `box-execution-control` (+ `arm-verdict`),
`box-opportunities` (+ `box-opportunity`, `box-leg-evaluation`),
`box-chains` (+ `box-chain-quote`), `box-open-trades` (+ `box-open-position`),
`box-trades-history` (+ `box-trade`, `box-trade-leg`), `box-execution-attempts`,
`box-events` (+ `box-event-leg`), `box-sse-snapshot`, `sse-envelope`,
`margin-provenance`.

Each schema's `description` states **how the contract test obtains a real sample of
it** — real HTTP against the mounted registrar, or a direct call to the real
serializer/engine method — so the provenance of every validated shape is auditable.

## Shared production projections (`src/runtime/projections.ts`)

Several public shapes are **re-projected** from internal read models inside
`src/index.ts` (the outbox status snapshot → `export-status`; the internal
`BrokerSessionState`/`BrokerHealthState` → `broker-session`/`broker-health`) so an
internal field cannot silently leak onto the wire. Those re-projections live in
`src/runtime/projections.ts` as pure exported functions (`projectExportStatus`,
`projectBrokerSession`, `projectBrokerHealth`). **Production and the contract test
call the identical function**, so the schema is validated against the shape the
endpoint actually emits — not against a hand-written stub that might omit a field.
The `regression: each re-projected shape's REAL key set …` test asserts, in both
directions, that each projection's emitted key set reconciles with its schema.

## Version history

| `contract_version` | Change |
|--------------------|--------|
| `1.0.0` | Initial contract. |
| `1.1.0` | **Additive, backward-compatible clarification.** Declared two fields the backend was *already sending* but the schemas omitted: `enabled` + `connected` on `export-status`, and `state` (`"waiting"｜"expired"｜"ready"｜"standby"`) on `broker-session`. **No wire shape changed** — the endpoints emitted these fields before and after; only the declared types + schemas were corrected to match the real projection. Chosen **minor** (not major) because no consumer that already tolerated the real responses breaks: the fields were present all along, so the change only tightens the schema to document what shipped. Also extracted the inline re-projections into `src/runtime/projections.ts` (zero behaviour change) so the contract tests validate the real projection. |
| `1.2.0` | **Additive protocol surface + schema-fidelity tightening. No wire shape changed.** (A) Added `protocol.json` as the single source of truth for the CSRF header name (`csrf_header`), the default session cookie name (`session_cookie_default`) and the CSRF cookie suffix (`csrf_cookie_suffix`), and extended `digest.mjs` to cover it so a rename changes `schemas_sha256`. The frontend must now read the header name from the vendored contract instead of hardcoding it. (B) `broker-session.schema.json` now marks `account_label`, `established_at` and `expires_at` **required** (nullable type `["string","null"]`) instead of optional, and `src/brokerRoutes.ts` `RedactedBrokerSession` declares them `string｜null` instead of `?` — matching the real `projectBrokerSession`, which has **always** populated all three (possibly `null`). The bytes on the wire are identical before and after; only the declared type/schema now match reality. |
