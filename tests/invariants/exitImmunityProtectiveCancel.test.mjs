/**
 * INVARIANT 20 — EXIT ALWAYS WINS, closing the PROTECTIVE_CANCEL gap.
 *
 * The audit found that invariant 20 ("none of the entry blockers may prevent a valid reduction of
 * already-owned exposure") names FOUR reduction operations that must never be blocked: EXIT,
 * protective cancellation, emergency residual flatten, and reconciliation-required reduction.
 *
 * The existing suites cover three of the four at the ORDER-MANAGER layer, but NOT protective
 * cancellation:
 *
 *   - tests/box/liveEntryOwnershipGuard.test.mjs proves an EXIT and an EMERGENCY_RESIDUAL still
 *     POST while `entryEnabled=false` AND the circuit breaker is open.
 *   - tests/box/exitImmunity.test.mjs proves the coordinator/gateway gates (capital cap, session
 *     budget, underlying lock, max-open-boxes, durable reservation outage) never block an
 *     EXIT/flatten.
 *   - tests/box/monitor.test.mjs (test 30) proves scanner STOP still auto-exits.
 *
 * None of them exercises PROTECTIVE_CANCEL under a disarmed entry / open breaker at the manager
 * boundary. `BoxOrderManager.cancelWorkingBoxOrders()` and a `purpose: "PROTECTIVE_CANCEL"`
 * `submit()` are both gated ONLY by `canManageExposure()` (i.e. `liveOrderEnabled`) — never by
 * `canEnter()` — so the enforcement exists; this suite proves it, so the "protective cancellation"
 * clause of invariant 20 is not a claim that nothing verifies.
 *
 * `stack.adapter.posts` / `stack.adapter.cancels` are appended only at the real broker boundary, so
 * "the cancel reached the broker" is a statement about a real mutation, not internal bookkeeping.
