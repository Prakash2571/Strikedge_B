/**
 * FINDING C — the HTTP readiness gate vs risk reduction, PINNED.
 *
 * The single readiness gate in src/index.ts refuses ALL mutating requests while the
 * process is not `ready` (i.e. `starting`, `failed` or `shutting_down`). That set
 * includes the operator's MANUAL risk-reducing routes:
 *
 *     POST /api/box/live/flatten
 *     POST /api/box/live/cancel-working
 *     POST /api/box/live/reconcile
 *     POST /api/box/trades/:id/close
 *     POST /api/box/execution/control        (the emergency-flatten control lives here)
 *
 * The audit judged this bounded-but-unpinned. This suite PINS the intended, correct
 * behaviour so it can never change silently:
 *
 *   (1) Each manual risk-reducing route returns 503 with the readiness reason while
 *       `starting` AND while `shutting_down`. This is DELIBERATE:
 *         • before readiness (`starting`) no durable exposure has been adopted, so a
 *           manual flatten would act on an empty, un-reconciled world — it MUST be
 *           refused;
 *         • refusing mutations during `shutting_down` is PRE-EXISTING behaviour (the
 *           old `shuttingDown` middleware already did this) — not a regression.
 *
 *   (2) The engine's AUTOMATIC risk reduction (automatic exit, protective
 *       cancellation, reconciliation, emergency residual flatten) is NOT
 *       readiness-gated. It is engine-internal and never passes through the HTTP
 *       readiness middleware at all. This is the invariant that actually matters: an
 *       HTTP gate must NEVER be able to stop risk reduction.
 *         • STRUCTURAL: the ReadinessController is imported ONLY by src/index.ts (the
 *           HTTP layer); no engine module under src/box/** references it, so the
 *           automatic reduction paths cannot consult it.
 *         • BEHAVIOURAL: a real engine order manager performs a PROTECTIVE_CANCEL and
 *           an EXIT with no readiness controller anywhere in the stack — proving the
 *           automatic path does not depend on HTTP readiness.
 *
 * Mirrors tests/readiness/readiness.test.mjs conventions: a REAL express app wired
 * with the SAME single readiness gate used by src/index.ts, driven by the REAL
 * ReadinessController from dist, served over node:http on 127.0.0.1:0 and probed
 * with fetch. The behavioural half reuses the live engine harness the invariant
 * suite uses (tests/box/liveEntryHarness.mjs), so "the cancel/exit reached the
 * broker" is a statement about a real mutation, not internal bookkeeping.
