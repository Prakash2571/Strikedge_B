/**
 * A Dhan token acquired AFTER boot must reach the RUNNING manager.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS PINS
 * StrikeEdge performs no broker OAuth: `BrokerTokenAcquisitionService` fetches the Dhan
 * token from CalSpread at 09:00 IST, persists it encrypted to `broker_sessions`, and
 * then calls `callbacks.installDhanToken()`.
 *
 * `ActiveBrokerManager` read `broker_sessions` in exactly one place — inlined inside
 * `restore()`, which runs ONCE at boot — and `installDhanToken` was wired as a no-op on
 * the (incorrect) reasoning that the Dhan client re-read its session on demand.
 *
 * So on a completely ordinary morning:
 *   08:50  process starts, restore() finds no Dhan session, dhanAccessToken = null
 *   09:00  token acquired and written to PostgreSQL, install callback does nothing
 *   all day  healthFor("dhan").authenticated === false
 *
 * The token was durable and the running process could not use it. Dhan could not be
 * selected as the active broker until someone restarted the process — and nothing in the
 * status output would have explained why, because the stored session was perfectly fine.
 *
 * `adoptStoredDhanSession()` closes it. These tests drive the REAL compiled manager
 * against the REAL encrypted PostgreSQL store, because the whole failure was that a
 * durable write did not become in-memory state — a mock of either half would have hidden
 * it exactly as the original reasoning did.
