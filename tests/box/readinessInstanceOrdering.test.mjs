/**
 * RESTART-AWARE READINESS ORDERING — a browser must not reject a restarted backend forever.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFECT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `operational_readiness.decision_generation` is minted by `++this.readinessDecisionGeneration`,
 * where the field is declared `private readinessDecisionGeneration = 0`. It is PROCESS-LOCAL. The
 * frontend accepted a decision only when its generation was strictly greater than the one already
 * rendered — correct for ordering concurrent responses from one process, and wrong across a restart:
 *
 *     browser has rendered generation 5000
 *     backend restarts; the counter resets; it publishes generation 1
 *     5000 > 1  ⇒  the browser rejects 1, and 2, and 3, … indefinitely
 *
 * The dashboard then shows a permission verdict from a process that no longer exists, and goes on
 * showing "entry permitted" long after the new process has decided otherwise. Only a manual reload
 * clears it.
 *
 * THE FIX IS NOT "ACCEPT SMALLER GENERATIONS". That would make a delayed response from the OLD
 * process overwrite the new one — the same bug pointing the other way. Ordering needs an order, so
 * the decision now carries a restart-durable `instance.boot_ordinal` minted atomically by
 * PostgreSQL, and decisions are ordered by the pair (boot_ordinal, decision_generation).
 *
 * This suite drives the REAL `orderReadinessDecision` — the shared rule the frontend vendors rather
 * than reimplementing — plus the real `buildOperationalReadiness` publication.
