/**
 * LIVE RESIDUAL FLATTENING MUST BE A REAL RETRY LOOP.
 *
 * A residual leg is naked option exposure we hold and did not want. The engine works it every
 * two seconds until it is flat. Before this fix that loop could not retry: the durable
 * `client_order_id` was derived from `(attemptId, residual.created_at, role)`, and `created_at`
 * is deliberately PRESERVED when the shrunken residual is written back — so every pass
 * regenerated a byte-identical identity.
 *
 *   filled 0  -> the durable intent upsert returned the existing non-CREATED intent, so
 *                `OrderManager.execute()` took its "a prior submission exists" branch, re-read
 *                the stale order and resolved. NO SECOND ORDER WAS EVER SENT.
 *   filled 40 -> the remaining quantity changed but the identity did not, so
 *                `assertIntentImmutableMatch` threw on `quantity` — and that error matched
 *                neither branch of the old catch, so it was swallowed, forever.
 *
 * WHY THESE TESTS ARE NOT MIRRORS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
 * They drive the REAL `BoxOrderManager` over a REAL durable-journal double and the REAL
 * `CentralBoxExecutionGateway` in live mode, and they assert on what reached the ADAPTER — i.e.
 * on whether an order was actually sent to the broker, which is the only thing that matters for
 * money. `loop()` below reproduces the engine's durable write-back (persist `res.remaining`,
 * then work it again) so identity reuse across passes is exercised exactly as in production.
 *
 * The negative control at the end re-introduces the OLD write-back (generation never advances)
 * against the SAME new code and proves the second POST disappears — so these tests are pinned to
 * the durable generation, not to any incidental detail of the new code.
 *
 * Pure and offline: no broker, no Mongo, no network.
