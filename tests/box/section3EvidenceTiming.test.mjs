/**
 * SECTION 3 — FUNDS/MARGIN EVIDENCE TIMING, on the REAL production path.
 *
 * REPORTED DEFECT (root cause). `CentralBoxExecutionGateway.evaluateEntryEconomics()` captured the
 * evaluation instant (`const now = this.now()`) BEFORE awaiting the funds and planned-margin reads.
 * The engine's providers (`src/box/engine.ts` funds / plannedMargin) stamp `observedAt: Date.now()`
 * AFTER their broker round trip resolves. So for any read that takes real time,
 *
 *     observedAt  >  now      ⇒      age = now - observedAt  <  0
 *
 * and `brokerFigure()` (src/box/boxCapital.ts) requires `age >= 0` to call a figure fresh. A
 * PERFECTLY FRESH broker response was therefore downgraded to "stale", marked unusable, and the
 * economic gate refused a valid live entry. The bug is invisible under a frozen test clock (the
 * pre-existing economicAdmissionWiring suite stamps `observedAt === now`), which is exactly why it
 * survived: it only appears when the clock ADVANCES across the awaits, i.e. always, in production.
 *
 * These tests drive the REAL gateway with a clock that advances during the provider awaits, the way
 * a real broker round trip does. They also pin the surrounding requirements: independent
 * observation timestamps, monotonic in-process aging, bounded reads, no revival of cached evidence,
 * evidence bound to broker/account/session identity, re-validation of the candidate and the order
 * plan after the asynchronous reads, and an explicit refusal (never a hang) when a read stalls.
 *
 * FAILING-FIRST: on 2a62398 the first test ("delayed but fresh ... ADMITS") fails with
 * `insufficient_available_funds` / `margin_evidence_stale_or_missing` because the age is negative.
