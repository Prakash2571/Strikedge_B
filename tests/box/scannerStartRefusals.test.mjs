/**
 * The scanner's REFUSAL MESSAGES are operator-facing safety copy.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * `BoxEngine.start()` refuses for two reasons, and both messages were inherited from
 * CalSpread where they were correct and in StrikeEdge were not:
 *
 *   1. It said "Box persistence is not configured (set MONGODB_URI)". In StrikeEdge
 *      PostgreSQL is the operational authority and MongoDB Atlas is an asynchronous
 *      reporting replica whose absence must NEVER block the scanner. `isBoxDbEnabled()`
 *      resolves to `isPgReady()`, so the only thing that can trip that branch is
 *      PostgreSQL. Telling an operator to fix Mongo while PostgreSQL is down sends them
 *      to the wrong database in the middle of a session.
 *
 *   2. It said "Connect to Zerodha before starting the box scanner". StrikeEdge runs
 *      either broker, so a Dhan-active deployment showed an instruction naming a broker
 *      it was not using.
 *
 * A wrong diagnostic is not cosmetic: it is the thing an operator acts on under time
 * pressure. These assertions pin the corrected copy so neither can silently regress.
 *
 * The engine is driven through its PUBLIC `start()` with fake providers — no database
 * and no broker — because the branches under test are the first two statements in the
 * method and are reached before any I/O.
