/**
 * DEFECT 1 — THE OWNERSHIP / "STILL WANTED" GUARD WAS NEVER WIRED INTO LIVE ENTRY.
 *
 * The coordinator composes an ownership-aware `stillWanted` (its own reservation-lease check folded
 * together with the caller's predicate) and passes it to the gateway. The live branch of
 * `simulateLeggingEntry` ignored it; only the PAPER simulator consulted it. So in live mode a Box
 * whose lease had been lost, whose scanner decision had gone stale, or whose entry had been
 * disarmed while its legs sat in broker pacing, still POSTed every leg.
 *
 * Every test below asserts on `adapter.posts`, which the recording adapter appends to ONLY after
 * the pre-POST callback has returned without throwing — i.e. exactly where the real HTTP request
 * would be issued. "Zero POSTs" is therefore a statement about broker mutations, not about
 * internal bookkeeping.
 *
 * The final group proves the guard is ENTRY-ONLY: the very same conditions must not impede an exit
 * or an emergency reduction, because those remove risk that is already on the book.
