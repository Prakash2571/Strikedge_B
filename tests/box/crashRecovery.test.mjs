/**
 * CRASH AND RESTART RECOVERY — the dangerous boundaries.
 *
 * A process can die at any instant. The durable intent journal exists so that after a restart the
 * system can establish broker truth and never: double-submit, double-count a fill, lose owned
 * exposure, or assume it is flat when it is not.
 *
 * Covers the required cases:
 *   8. Crash after POST does not double-submit.
 *   9. Crash after fill does not lose exposure.
 *  10. Reconciliation restores the correct remainder.
 *
 * Plus the boundaries either side of those: before POST, after ACK, after a partial, during a
 * cancel, and after a cancel request but before the terminal confirmation.
 *
 * Offline: an in-memory intent journal and a fake adapter. No broker, no Mongo, no network.
