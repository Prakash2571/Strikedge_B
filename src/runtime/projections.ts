/**
 * SHARED WIRE PROJECTIONS — the single source of truth for how internal read
 * models are re-projected into the PUBLIC HTTP shapes.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 * `src/index.ts` deliberately RE-PROJECTS several internal shapes into their public
 * contract shapes rather than passing them through, so that a future field added to
 * an internal type (a broker session, the outbox status snapshot) cannot silently
 * leak onto the wire. The catch is that when those projections are built as inline
 * object literals inside index.ts they are UNTESTABLE — the contract suite could
 * only validate a hand-written stub that happens to resemble the projection, not
 * the projection itself. That is exactly how two real fields (`enabled`/`connected`
 * on export status and `state` on a broker session) shipped without ever appearing
 * in the declared type or the schema.
 *
 * THE FIX: extract each re-projection into a small PURE function here, and have BOTH
 * src/index.ts (production) AND the contract test call the identical function. The
 * returned object is byte-identical to the old inline literal — this is a pure
 * refactor with ZERO behaviour change. The point is that production and the
 * contract test now share one projection, so the schema is validated against the
 * REAL shape the endpoint emits.
 *
 * NO SECRETS
 * None of these projections may carry a raw/encrypted token, the site passcode or
 * any key material. They emit states, counts, ages, timestamps and redacted labels
 * only — the same guarantee the consuming route modules document.
