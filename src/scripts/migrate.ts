/**
 * `npm run migrate` — apply checked-in SQL migrations, or `--check` to assert the
 * database is fully migrated without touching it.
 *
 * This is the deliberate release step for deployments that run with
 * `PG_MIGRATE_ON_BOOT=false`: the schema is advanced here, as an explicit action,
 * and the process then refuses to boot against a database that is behind the code.
 *
 * It loads `.env`, initialises the pool, runs (or checks) migrations, prints a
 * single honest line of counts, and exits non-zero on any failure so CI and a
 * release script can gate on it. It never prints a connection string with
 * credentials — `pgStatus()` already redacts the target.
