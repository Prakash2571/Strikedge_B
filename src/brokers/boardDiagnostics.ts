/**
 * Why a parsed instrument universe becomes the board it becomes.
 *
 * The failure this exists to explain: 200+ real futures parsed correctly, yet the board
 * rendered ONE card. `deriveFnoBoard()` silently drops any futures group whose underlying
 * cannot be matched to a spot instrument — which is correct behaviour, but invisible.
 * With no visibility, "the board has one stock" and "the market is quiet" look identical.
 *
 * So this reports the join, stage by stage, and names the underlyings that were dropped
 * along with the reason. Pure: it takes an instrument list and returns a report, so it is
 * testable without a network or a broker.
