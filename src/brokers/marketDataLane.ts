/**
 * MARKET-DATA LANES — two physically separate upstream feeds for ONE active broker.
 *
 * WHY TWO
 * The calendar-spread board and the Box scanner have genuinely different appetites.
 * The board wants a few hundred futures and spot instruments and is latency-tolerant.
 * The Box scanner wants thousands of option strikes with depth, and every strike the
 * board's set displaces is an arbitrage it cannot see. Sharing one connection and one
 * token budget means the two compete: today `BOX_MAX_SUBSCRIBED_TOKENS` (2200) exists
 * precisely because the Box universe has to be trimmed to fit alongside everything
 * else, and the union of browser + strategy tokens is bounded by nothing at all.
 *
 * Splitting them gives each workload its own socket, its own refcount table, its own
 * budget, and its own health — so a wide option universe cannot starve the board, and
 * a busy board cannot starve the scanner.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * It is NOT two brokers running at once. Exactly one broker is ACTIVE, and both lanes
 * belong to it. If Zerodha is active there are two Zerodha sockets and no Dhan socket
 * is trading or scanning; if Dhan is active, the mirror. The single-active invariant
 * and the broker-generation model are unchanged — a lane is a workload, not a venue.
 *
 * WHY A TYPE RATHER THAN A BOOLEAN
 * `isBox = true` at a call site tells you nothing about what the false case is, and it
 * cannot be exhaustively checked. A lane is named, switch-exhaustive, and reads
 * correctly in a log line.
 *
 * CONNECTION BUDGET
 * Zerodha permits 3 WebSocket connections per API key. Two are used here (one per
 * lane) and the third is deliberately left free for a separate service. PM2 restarts
 * stop the old process before starting the new one, so a deploy never needs four.
 * Dhan permits 5 sockets per user with 5000 instruments each, so two lanes fit
 * comfortably. Neither number is bypassed or exceeded: this module fixes the lane
 * count at two by construction — there is no code path that opens an unbounded number
 * of sockets.
