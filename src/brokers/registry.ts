/**
 * ActiveBrokerManager — the single authority on which broker owns the system.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT IT EXISTS TO ENFORCE
 * Exactly ONE broker at a time owns the market-data feed, the scanner, Box
 * execution, positions, reconciliation, margins and charges. Historical trades from
 * both brokers coexist in the database forever; only one broker ever creates or
 * monitors new ones.
 *
 * That is not achievable by convention. Two feeds can physically both be connected,
 * two adapters can both hold a session, and stale depth from a previous broker looks
 * exactly like current depth to the scanner. So the rule is enforced structurally:
 *
 *   - Everything broker-specific is reachable only through `runtime()`, which
 *     returns ONE runtime. There is no way to ask for "the Dhan feed" while Zerodha
 *     is active.
 *   - A switch is a guarded, ordered transition (`switchBroker`) that refuses while
 *     exposure exists and, when it proceeds, TEARS DOWN the old broker before the
 *     new one is reachable.
 *   - Books never survive a switch. `stop()` on each feed discards its quote state,
 *     and the Box quote store is cleared, so Zerodha depth can never price a Dhan
 *     decision.
 *
 * WHY SWITCHING IS REFUSED RATHER THAN QUEUED
 * A switch while a box is open would leave a real position monitored by the wrong
 * feed and reconciled against the wrong order-id space. There is no safe automatic
 * resolution, so the operator is told what to close first (HTTP 409) instead of the
 * system guessing.

   *
   * WHY THIS IS PUBLIC AND NOT JUST PART OF `restore()`
   * It used to be inlined in `restore()`, which runs ONCE at boot — and that was a
   * real bug in the StrikeEdge token flow. The daily acquisition service persists a
   * freshly fetched Dhan token to `broker_sessions` and then calls back to say it is
   * installed; with rehydration reachable only from boot, that callback had nothing to
   * call. The token was durable but the RUNNING manager still held
   * `dhanAccessToken = null`, so on any normal morning (process up before 09:00 IST,
   * token acquired at 09:00) Dhan reported itself unauthenticated for the whole
   * session and could not be selected as the active broker without a process restart.
   *
   * Now the acquisition service calls this after every successful Dhan persist, so the
   * durable write and the in-memory install are the same event from the caller's point
   * of view. It re-reads from the store rather than accepting a token argument
   * deliberately: PostgreSQL is the authority, decryption stays inside the session
   * provider, and no plaintext token has to be threaded through another interface.
   *
   * Idempotent, and safe to call when no session is stored (it then changes nothing).
   * An EXPIRED stored session is cleared rather than adopted — a dead token installed
   * in memory would make `authenticated` true for one expiry check and then fail at the
   * broker, which is strictly worse than reporting the truth.
   *
   * ABSENCE AND FAILURE ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS
   *   - PostgreSQL confirmed there is no active Dhan row → `false` ("not connected")
   *   - the stored session is present but expired         → `false`, and it is invalidated
   *   - the query failed, or the row cannot be decrypted  → REJECTS
   *
   * The third case used to be `.catch(() => null)`, i.e. reported as "Dhan is not
   * connected". That is a lie with consequences in both directions: at boot it let the
   * process come up believing a connected broker was unauthenticated, and on the daily
   * token path it made a decryption misconfiguration look like a missing token, so the
   * service would discard a perfectly good stored credential and re-acquire. The
   * rejection now propagates: boot fails closed, and the token acquisition service
   * records the bounded reason in its status and retries on its existing schedule.
   *
   * No plaintext token appears in any error or log on any of these paths.
