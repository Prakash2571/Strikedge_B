/**
 * Dhan's charge model for NSE equity OPTIONS.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `localCharges.ts` WITH A DIFFERENT NUMBER
 * The statutory heads (STT, exchange transaction charge, SEBI turnover fee, stamp
 * duty, GST) are set by the exchange and the government — identical at every broker.
 * BROKERAGE is not. Zerodha bills a flat ₹20 per executed option order; Dhan's plans
 * differ, and on a four-leg box the round trip is EIGHT orders, so a ₹5 per-order
 * difference moves the expected-net gate by ₹40. The Box entry gate is a ₹1,200
 * decision, and spending Zerodha's brokerage while trading at Dhan would make the
 * gate quietly wrong in the broker's favour.
 *
 * So the rate card is broker-specific and every produced record is labelled
 * `computed_by: "dhan_estimate"` with `broker: "dhan"` — never "local", which the UI
 * renders as the Zerodha local calculator.
 *
 * ROUNDING IS COPIED DELIBERATELY from localCharges.ts (per-head round2, STT to the
 * nearest rupee, GST on brokerage + exchange + SEBI only) so a Dhan contract note is
 * structurally interchangeable with a Zerodha one and the two are comparable.
