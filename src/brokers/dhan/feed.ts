/**
 * The single shared DhanHQ v2 market feed.
 *
 * ONE SOCKET, FANNED OUT — deliberately mirroring the existing Kite `TickerHub`.
 * Dhan allows many instruments per connection, so a socket per underlying (or worse,
 * per trade) would burn connections for nothing and make the connection limit a
 * latent outage. Every consumer — the Box quote store, SSE clients, analytics —
 * attaches to this one instance.
 *
 * PARTIAL PACKETS MUST BE MERGED, NOT PUBLISHED RAW
 * Dhan's packet types are partial by design: a Ticker carries only an LTP, an OI
 * packet only open interest. Publishing each in isolation would repeatedly hand
 * consumers a "quote" whose bid/ask were zero. So the feed keeps the last known
 * FULL state per instrument and merges each packet into it, emitting a complete
 * tick. The decoder stays pure and never invents fields; assembling state is this
 * layer's job.
 *
 * `exchange_ts` IS ALWAYS ABSENT — see toTick().
