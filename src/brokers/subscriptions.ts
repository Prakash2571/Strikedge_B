/**
 * Refcounted market-data subscription coordinator.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
 * One instrument token can be wanted simultaneously by several independent
 * consumers: two browser SSE clients, the Box scanner, an open Box position, and a
 * headless analytics job. Before this existed, `/api/stream` registered browser
 * tokens straight into the Kite hub, which meant two things went wrong at once:
 *
 *   1. The LAST consumer to disconnect could unsubscribe a token that others still
 *      needed — or, worse, `hub.stop()` tore down the whole feed.
 *   2. Browser subscriptions reached Kite DIRECTLY, so opening a browser tab while
 *      Dhan was the active broker opened a ZERODHA WebSocket.
 *
 * So subscriptions are now owned, counted, and diffed:
 *
 *   consumer (browser/scanner/strategy/analytics)
 *        -> SubscriptionCoordinator  (refcount per owner class)
 *        -> ActiveBrokerManager.subscribeTokens()
 *        -> the ACTIVE broker's socket only
 *
 * UPSTREAM SEES ONLY TRANSITIONS. A token is subscribed upstream when its total
 * refcount goes 0 -> 1 and unsubscribed when it returns to 0. Never more than once,
 * so there are no duplicate upstream subscriptions.
 *
 * GENERATION-SCOPED. Kite tokens and Dhan tokens are different namespaces, so a
 * broker switch invalidates every registration: `resetForBrokerSwitch()` drops the
 * whole table rather than trying to translate tokens that have no counterpart.

 *     and a Box strike can never be dropped because a browser closed a chart;
