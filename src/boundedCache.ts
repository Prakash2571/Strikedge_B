/**
 * A TTL cache that cannot grow without bound.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * `POST /api/quotes` cached its response under a key derived from the CALLER'S token set
 * (`broker:generation:sortedTokens`). The TTL only decided whether an entry was *served* —
 * expired entries were never removed and there was no size cap. Since the route is
 * unauthenticated and accepts up to 4000 tokens, every distinct token permutation left a
 * permanent entry holding a full `Tick[]` including five-level depth ladders. The board,
 * a filtered board, a search result and each stock's detail page are all different
 * permutations, so this grew steadily in normal use and unboundedly under load until the
 * process OOM'd.
 *
 * The fix is a cache that evicts, not a bigger cache. Two independent bounds:
 *   1. TTL   — an entry past its age is deleted, not merely ignored.
 *   2. SIZE  — a hard entry cap with oldest-first eviction.
 *
 * Deliberately tiny and synchronous: no timers to leak, no dependencies, and the sweep is
 * amortised onto writes so there is nothing to shut down.
