/**
 * IST clock — the single source of "what day is it, in Asia/Kolkata" for the
 * token scheduler and the broker session validators.
 *
 * WHY A FIXED +5:30 OFFSET, NOT `Intl`
 * India has never observed daylight saving, so the IST offset is a constant
 * +5:30. `src/boxSupport.ts` `istDayKey` computes the P&L day key with exactly
 * this arithmetic, and every durable day key CalSpread ever wrote was produced
 * that way. If the token scheduler used `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with a named zone
 * instead, a subtle disagreement at the midnight boundary between two libraries
 * could make "today" mean two different things in two subsystems. It must mean
 * one thing everywhere, so this file reproduces the boxSupport arithmetic
 * byte-for-byte rather than reimplementing it.
 *
 * WHY AN INJECTABLE CLOCK
 * The scheduler makes decisions at 09:00 IST and "immediately if started after
 * 09:00". Tests must be able to place the process at an arbitrary instant without
 * waiting for a wall clock, so every time decision goes through an `IstClock`
 * whose `now()` a test can freeze and advance. Production wires the real clock;
 * nothing reads `Date.now()` directly.
 *
 * WHY SCHEDULING MUST NOT DRIFT WITH UPTIME
 * The daily poll-start must fire at 09:00 IST every trading morning, not "24h
 * after the process booted". `msUntilNextDailyTime` always computes the delay
 * from the current IST wall time to the next occurrence of HH:MM, so a process
 * that has been up for three days still fires at 09:00, not at 09:00-plus-drift.
