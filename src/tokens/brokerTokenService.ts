/**
 * BrokerTokenAcquisitionService — the daily, per-broker token acquisition loop.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 * Each trading morning at BROKER_TOKEN_POLL_START (09:00 IST) it asks the CalSpread
 * provider for a Zerodha token and a Dhan token, INDEPENDENTLY. Each broker has its
 * own state machine, its own timer and its own in-flight guard, so:
 *   - the two requests can run concurrently but never overwrite each other;
 *   - one slow or failing provider never blocks or discards the other's token;
 *   - success stops polling ONLY for that broker, for that IST day.
 *
 * SCHEDULING (no uptime drift)
 * Before 09:00 IST it schedules the first attempt for 09:00. If the process starts
 * AFTER 09:00 and a broker lacks a valid token for the current IST day, it fetches
 * IMMEDIATELY. All delays are computed from the current IST wall time via
 * `istClock`, so a process up for days still fires at 09:00, not 09:00-plus-uptime.
 *
 * WHAT SUCCESS TRIGGERS (via INJECTED callbacks, never a direct engine import)
 * On a validated token the service persists it (encrypted) and calls the callbacks
 * the boot wiring supplied. For Zerodha, `onZerodhaReady` installs the key+token
 * into the Kite client, loads the universe, and — ONLY IF Zerodha is the ACTIVE
 * broker — starts the single Box WebSocket, resubscribes, invalidates stale books
 * and lets scanner readiness follow fresh depth. This module imports NONE of the
 * engine; it only calls what it was handed.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 * Token acquisition, storage and market data NEVER arm live trading. There is no
 * path here that flips a live gate or constructs a mutation-capable adapter.
