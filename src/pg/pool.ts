/**
 * The PostgreSQL connection pool — StrikeEdge's single operational authority.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SMALL AND EXPLICIT
 * CalSpread's Box module reached Mongo through Mongoose models, which meant a
 * compare-and-set was expressed as a `findOneAndUpdate` filter and the durable
 * pre-write value had to be inferred from the returned document. StrikeEdge
 * replaces that with real SQL transactions and `UPDATE ... RETURNING`, so the
 * pre-write and post-write values are both authoritative and both come back from
 * the same statement. An ORM would obscure exactly the behaviour that matters, so
 * there is not one: this module owns a `pg.Pool` and nothing else.
 *
 * DURABILITY
 * `synchronous_commit` is deliberately NOT touched. Order-intent transitions must
 * be durable before a broker POST, so the session keeps the server default (`on`).
 * A per-session `SET synchronous_commit = off` would make every guarantee in
 * `docs/EXTRACTION_MANIFEST.md` false, so no code path here may set it.
 *
 * TIMEOUTS
 * Every pooled connection gets `statement_timeout` and `lock_timeout` applied on
 * connect. A wedged statement inside the execution path is worse than a failed
 * one: the caller can fail closed on an error, but it cannot fail closed on a
 * promise that never settles.

  /**
   * Applied per PHYSICAL connection, so a pool that grows later inherits them.
   *
   * WHY THE UN-AWAITED `void` IS CORRECT — DO NOT "FIX" IT
   * `pg` does not await this handler, so it looks like the first caller query could run
   * before the timeouts land. It cannot: the handler runs synchronously during the
   * `connect` event and `client.query` ENQUEUES on the client's FIFO query queue, which
   * `pg` drains in order. The SET is therefore always ahead of the caller's first
   * statement. Verified empirically against five simultaneously-created connections, all
   * of which reported `statement_timeout = 5s` on their very first query.
   *
   * A libpq `options=-c statement_timeout=…` startup parameter would be stronger still
   * (server-side, before any query), but it is deliberately NOT used here: a config-level
   * `options` takes precedence over one in the connection string, and
   * `tests/pg/helpers.mjs` puts `options=-csearch_path=<schema>` in the URL to isolate each
   * test file. Setting it here would silently drop that search_path and collapse every pg
   * test into the `public` schema. Merging the two is possible but buys nothing over the
   * ordering guarantee above.
   *
   * The `.catch` is a swallow of last resort: on a healthy connection a `SET` does not
   * fail, and if it somehow did, throwing inside an event handler would take the process
   * down rather than degrade one connection.
