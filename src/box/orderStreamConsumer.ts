/**
 * ORDER-STREAM CONSUMER — the PRODUCTION component that makes a broker order-update stream
 * actually resolve fills, instead of merely relabelling status.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS / WHAT IT WIRES TOGETHER
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Before this, every piece was built and unit-tested but nothing constructed and connected them:
 *
 *   transports          brokers/zerodha/orderUpdates.ts (parseKiteOrderFrame)
 *                       brokers/dhan/orderFeed.ts        (DhanOrderFeed / parseDhanOrderAlert)
 *   ONE truth           box/orderUpdateProjection.ts     (OrderUpdateProjection)
 *   the wake seam       box/{kite,dhan}BrokerAdapter.ts  (applyOrderUpdate → wakes order waiters)
 *   the health machine  box/streamHealthPolicy.ts        (OrderStreamStateMachine + permissions)
 *
 * This class owns ONE {@link OrderUpdateProjection} and ONE {@link OrderStreamStateMachine} per
 * active broker account, and is the single point where a normalized observation — from the stream
 * OR from REST — is (1) attributed and deduplicated through the projection, and (2) handed to the
 * adapter's {@link BrokerAdapter.applyOrderUpdate}, which re-validates the evidence, applies it
 * cumulative-monotonically to the session snapshot, and WAKES that order's waiters. That last step
 * is what makes a stream event resolve a live `waitForResolution` loop BEFORE its REST poll fires.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE RULES THIS CLASS ENFORCES (each maps to the task brief)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - OWNERSHIP FIRST, BEFORE THE POST. {@link registerIntent} is called as the durable intent
 *    enters SUBMITTING — before the HTTP POST — so an event that beats the placement response has
 *    a ledger to land in. Account-wide events for orders we did not place are rejected as unowned.
 *  - ONE PROJECTION OF TRUTH. Stream and REST both funnel through the same projection, so dedup
 *    and monotonicity hold across both sources; a stream only ever makes the SAME truth arrive
 *    sooner, never a second, racing truth.
 *  - MISSING ≠ ZERO. An observation whose quantity is ABSENT (a Kite postback with no
 *    filled_quantity, a Dhan TRADED/CANCELLED with no TradedQty) is attributed but applies NO
 *    quantity; it schedules a targeted REST reconciliation to obtain the real figure. It is never
 *    read as a confirmed zero fill.
 *  - SOCKET-OPEN IS NOT READY. Health is driven by the state machine: only a completed
 *    reconciliation reaches READY. Loss → DISCONNECTED (bounded REST, no new entry, exposure
 *    management continues); reconnect → RECONCILING until the gap is repaired; auth reject →
 *    AUTH_EXPIRED. A missing event is never a zero fill.
 *
 * PURITY. This class holds no sockets and no timers of its own. The transports own the sockets and
 * call the lifecycle hooks; the clock is injected. REST reconciliation is a callback the caller
 * (which owns the adapter's REST transport) supplies, so this class never makes a network call.

     *   - OPEN(0) → CANCELLED(0): the cumulative is 0 both times, so the ledger returns
     *     `stale_cumulative` and the CANCELLATION never reached order management. The order stayed
     *     "working" until a REST poll happened to notice, and the leg's waiter was never woken.
     *   - OPEN(0) → REJECTED(0): identical, and worse — a rejection is precisely the event a caller
     *     is waiting on to stop.
     *   - PARTIAL(q) → CANCELLED(q): same cumulative q, so the cancellation of the REMAINDER
     *     vanished while the fill was (correctly) kept.
     *   - A later average-price enrichment at unchanged quantity was dropped entirely.
     *
     * So the three tracks are now scored separately:
     *   1. EXECUTED QUANTITY — owned exclusively by the cumulative ledger above. Monotonic,
     *      idempotent, and the ONLY thing that may create exposure.
     *   2. LIFECYCLE / STATUS — a change in the broker's status LABEL is meaningful state even when
     *      the quantity is untouched.
     *   3. EXECUTION ENRICHMENT — a change in average price for quantity we already hold.
     *
     * FORWARDING A STATUS CHANGE CANNOT CREATE A FILL. `applyToAdapter` passes the SAME confirmed
     * cumulative the ledger just deduplicated, and every adapter's `applyOrderUpdate` is
     * cumulative-monotonic (it refuses a quantity below what it already holds and never re-adds a

     * `TRADED`, `PART_TRADED`, `COMPLETE`, `CLOSED` and `EXPIRED` mean different things at the two
     * brokers, and that normalization belongs in the adapters (kiteState / dhanOrderState), which
     * already do it. Here the status is compared as an opaque string, and the adapter's OWN
