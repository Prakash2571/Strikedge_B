/**
 * INDEPENDENT PAPER ORDER LIFECYCLES — one per box leg.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 *
 * A box is four orders, and four-leg arbitrage is killed by the things a single
 * shared snapshot cannot express: legs filling at different instants, one leg
 * resting while the others are already on, a leg that only PARTIALLY fills and
 * rests for more liquidity, and a leg that never fills. So each leg here is a real
 * order with its own lifecycle:
 *
 *   CREATED → SUBMITTED → IN_FLIGHT → (arrival) walk the book within the LIMIT
 *      → FILLED                    (took the whole lot)
 *      → PARTIALLY_FILLED → rest → complete on a later book → FILLED
 *                                 → or TIMED_OUT at arrival + legTimeoutMs
 *      → PENDING (nothing executable within the limit yet) → …
 *
 * FOUR RULES THAT MUST NOT REGRESS
 *
 *  1. MARKETABLE LIMIT, NOT A MARKET ORDER. Every order carries a limit price a
 *     bounded number of ticks past the reference touch (see executionPolicy /
 *     orderPricing). The book is walked only down to that limit; a level worse
 *     than the limit is never taken. An order that cannot fill within its limit
 *     RESTS — it does not consume a runaway price.
 *
 *  2. NEVER INVENT A PRICE. Every fill slice is an observed executable level from a
 *     real WebSocket book, recorded with its version and receive timestamp. No
 *     random slippage anywhere.
 *
 *  3. RESTING BOOK. A book need not publish a new tick after arrival to be valid:
 *     at arrival we walk the latest known valid book. Only what it cannot fill
 *     rests, and a later update may complete it.
 *
 *  4. CONSERVATIVE QUEUE. Displayed depth is not assumed to be all ours (see the
 *     queue model in orderPricing). Deterministic; no randomness.
 *
 * EVENT-DRIVEN, YET DETERMINISTIC
 *
 * Pending/partial orders are woken by the quote store's `subscribe()` seam, which
 * fires synchronously as a depth packet is applied — so a fill is stamped with the
 * TICK'S OWN timestamp. Timers are used only for arrival and timeout deadlines. The
 * clock and the sleep are injected, so a recorded tick stream reproduces
 * byte-identical fills, prices and P&L. Scheduling is driven by ONE coordinating
 * loop, never four concurrent waiters (which would race a shared simulated clock).

/**
 * LIVE-PARITY ONLY: the cancel-vs-fill race model.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (audit divergence D17)
 *
 * In real trading a cancel is a REQUEST, not an outcome. Between the DELETE leaving our wire
 * and the broker confirming a terminal state, the exchange can still match some or all of the
 * resting quantity. The live adapters already respect this — `confirmTerminalAfterCancel()`
 * re-reads the order until it is genuinely terminal, and the durable state machine explicitly
 * permits `CANCEL_REQUESTED → COMPLETE`. Paper did not model it at all: `abandon()` was
 * instantaneous, so a paper order could never be filled after a cancel was requested.
 *
 * That gap flatters paper in the most dangerous possible way. A live protective cancel that
 * loses the race leaves REAL, irreversible exposure that must be unwound; the paper equivalent
 * reported a clean cancellation and no exposure at all. Any statistic derived from that — fill
 * rate, residual rate, unwind frequency — was optimistic by construction.
 *
 * WHEN SUPPLIED, a cancel becomes a two-phase operation: the order enters
 * `CANCEL_REQUESTED` and REMAINS eligible to fill from observed books until the confirmation
 * deadline drawn from `latencyMs()`. WHEN UNDEFINED (standard paper) cancellation stays
 * instantaneous and behaviour is byte-for-byte what it was.
 *
 * NO INVENTED FILLS. Quantity taken during the race window comes from the same observed
 * WebSocket books, the same limit and the same shared liquidity ledger as any other fill. The
 * only thing being modelled is the WINDOW — its length comes from measured
 * `cancel_request_to_terminal_ms` samples, and nothing is fabricated inside it.
