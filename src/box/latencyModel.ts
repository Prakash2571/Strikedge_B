/**
 * STRUCTURED LATENCY MODEL — the vocabulary of measurable execution delay, plus a
 * deterministic source that turns REAL measured samples into paper scheduling inputs.
 *
 * WHY NOT "latency = 250 ms"
 *
 * A single constant either hides the tail (optimistic) or overweights it (pessimistic),
 * and — worse — it collapses stages that behave very differently. A live four-leg Box
 * entry's time-to-fill is really the sum of distinct, separately-measurable stages:
 *
 *   detection → internal processing → OrderManager queue wait → transport pacing wait →
 *   HTTP/network → broker/RMS ACK → waiting for executable liquidity → first fill → …
 *
 * This module names those stages ({@link LATENCY_COMPONENTS}) so live observability can
 * measure each one independently and paper can be calibrated from the ones we can
 * actually observe — never from a random generator.
 *
 * WHAT PAPER NEEDS FROM CALIBRATION
 *
 * The paper scheduler ({@link ../paperScheduler}) computes `queue_wait_ms` and
 * `transport_wait_ms` itself from the shared policy — those are a function of the queue
 * and the min-interval, not of the broker. What it CANNOT compute, and must be fed from
 * measured live data, are the broker-side spans:
 *
 *   - `post_to_ack_ms`   — POST leaves the wire → broker acknowledges (order live).
 *   - `ack_to_terminal_ms` — ACK → the order resolves (the slot is held this long).
 *
 * {@link StructuredLatencySource} supplies exactly those two, drawn deterministically
 * (never `Math.random()`), per broker, so paper's slot occupancy and exchange-arrival
 * timing match what the account actually experienced.
 *
 * DETERMINISM & CALIBRATION HONESTY
 *
 * Draws are reproducible. And the source ALWAYS reports whether it is running on measured
 * samples or a conservative constant fallback ({@link CalibrationStatus}), so nothing ever
 * pretends a constant is measured live latency.
