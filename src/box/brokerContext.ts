/**
 * The broker-neutral dependencies the Box strategy is allowed to know about.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * BoxEngine used to import `KiteClient` and construct `KiteBrokerAdapter` /
 * `KiteHttpTransport` itself. That made the strategy structurally dependent on
 * one venue: adding a second broker would have meant either a second engine (two
 * copies of the box maths — unacceptable) or `if (broker === "dhan")` branches
 * threaded through the decision path (worse).
 *
 * So the engine now depends only on the three narrow interfaces below. Concrete
 * brokers are assembled OUTSIDE the strategy and injected. The engine cannot name
 * Zerodha or Dhan, and therefore cannot accidentally prefer one.
 *
 * The surface is deliberately tiny — it is exactly what the engine actually used
 * from `KiteClient`, no more:
 *   - an authentication predicate
 *   - REST snapshot quotes (for the last-close view and the spot seed)
 *   - a basket-margin call
 *   - a factory for the live order adapter
