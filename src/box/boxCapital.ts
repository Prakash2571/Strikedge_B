/**
 * MAXIMUM ₹ EXPOSURE PER BOX — the admission metric and its gate.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NUMBER IS
 *
 * `gross_entry_order_notional_rupees` = SUM over the four ENTRY legs of
 *
 *     |limit_price x quantity|
 *
 * computed from the ACTUAL bounded LIMIT order requests that would be transmitted. It is
 * the largest rupee amount those four immutable orders can transact, because a LIMIT order
 * can never fill worse than its limit and the Box never uses MARKET orders.
 *
 * WHAT THIS NUMBER IS **NOT**
 *
 * It is NOT broker margin. It is NOT SPAN+exposure. It is NOT the capital the broker will
 * actually block. A four-leg Box is a hedged structure and its real margin requirement is
 * typically a small fraction of gross option notional — sometimes it is a NET CREDIT. The
 * naming is deliberate and the code must never be edited to call this "margin", because an
 * operator who reads "margin: ₹120,000" and sets a ₹120,000 cap would be setting a limit
 * roughly an order of magnitude away from what they intended.
 *
 * If a reliable broker margin API is available its answer is exposed SEPATATELY as
 * `broker_estimated_margin_rupees` (see {@link BoxCapitalReport}) and is never substituted
 * for the admission metric: one is an observable property of our own bounded orders, the
 * other is a remote estimate that can fail, lag, or be denied.
 *
 * WHY GROSS NOTIONAL IS STILL THE RIGHT ADMISSION GATE
 *
 * It is deterministic, computable offline from data we already hold, monotone in quantity
 * and price, and CONSERVATIVE (it always over-states the economic risk of a hedged Box).
 * An operator using it is expressing "do not let one Box transact more than ₹X of option
 * premium", which is a meaningful, auditable sentence. It requires no broker round trip, so
 * it can be evaluated at the last safe moment before submission — which a remote margin
 * call cannot.
 *
 * PRECISION
 *
 * All comparisons are done in INTEGER PAISE. Rupee floats cannot represent ₹0.01 exactly,
 * and the specification requires that ₹0.01 over the cap is refused while exactly at the
 * cap is admitted. Comparing paise integers makes that boundary exact rather than
 * dependent on IEEE-754 rounding.

// THE FIVE DISTINCT ECONOMIC QUANTITIES  (Task 9)
//
// The gross-notional metric above is ONE of five quantities an honest admission gate must keep
// separate. Conflating any two of them is how a box is admitted that the broker will reject, or
// that will breach available funds during the legging window even though the final hedged
// position is cheap. The five, never to be substituted for one another:
//
//   1. AVAILABLE broker funds            — what the account can actually deploy right now.
//   2. Margin required by the PLANNED     — the broker's own estimate for the four-leg basket,
//      execution sequence                   from a SUPPORTED margin facility (Kite basket /
//                                            Dhan multi). An ESTIMATE, never a guarantee of
//                                            acceptance.
//   3. PEAK TEMPORARY EXPOSURE            — the most capital tied up at any instant DURING
//      (the legging window)                 legging, before all four legs and their hedge
//                                            benefit exist. Can far exceed (2).
//   4. GROSS order notional              — the existing metric above. Deterministic, offline,
//                                            conservative. Keeps its label.
//   5. Bounded WORST-CASE entry prices   — the largest the four LIMIT orders can cost, and the
//      and estimated costs                  estimated charges on top. Deterministic from the
//                                            bounded requests.
//
// PROVENANCE is a first-class type here. Every remote figure is tagged with where it came from,
// when, and whether it is a broker-CONFIRMED value or our own ESTIMATE. A stale or failed fetch
// yields an explicit `unavailable`/`stale` status that the gate treats as "cannot prove", never
// as an optimistic zero.
