/**
 * Redis (Upstash) mirror of TODAY's closed box trades.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The Closed-trades tab used to be served by one Mongo query over the WHOLE
 * closed book (`loadClosedBoxTrades`), sorted on `closed_at`. That query is both
 * slow and fragile — it is the only read on the page that can fail outright —
 * while the thing the operator actually wants the instant the page opens is a
 * small, bounded set: the trades closed TODAY. So today's trades are mirrored
 * here as they close and read back in one round trip; earlier days stay in Mongo,
 * where taking a moment to load is acceptable.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, LIKE EVERY OTHER REDIS USE (see redis.ts)
 * Every method is a no-op returning a neutral value when the feature is off or
 * Redis is unreachable, and the caller falls back to Mongo. A cache must never be
 * able to hide trades or take the app down.
 *
 * LAYOUT
 *   calspread:box:trades:closed:<YYYY-MM-DD>   hash  field=trade_id -> trade JSON
 *
 * HSET overwrites a trade's field, so re-mirroring an already-cached trade is
 * idempotent — which is what makes the boot seed and the per-close write safe to
 * run over each other.
