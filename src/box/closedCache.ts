/**
 * Closed-today trade cache surface — REDIS REMOVED.
 *
 * In CalSpread this mirrored TODAY's closed box trades into Upstash Redis so the
 * Closed-trades tab could render the current session in one round trip instead of a
 * whole-book Mongo sort. It was ALWAYS a best-effort read-path accelerator: every
 * method was a no-op returning a neutral value when Redis was off or unreachable, and
 * the caller fell back to the definitionally-complete database.
 *
 * StrikeEdge's complete source for "closed today" is now PostgreSQL
 * (`loadBoxTradesClosedSince`, see `repository.ts` / `engine.getClosedToday`). The Redis
 * mirror was PURELY A CACHE, so it is removed rather than reimplemented: the cache
 * reports itself disabled and every read/write degrades to the neutral value, which is
 * exactly the fall-through the engine already handles. The exported SURFACE is preserved
 * (`liteClosedTrade`, `sortClosedNewestFirst`, `BoxClosedTradeCache`) so no caller
 * changes.
