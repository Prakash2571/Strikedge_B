   *     hedged box instead. Refusing leg 4 after legs 1-3 reached the broker manufactures a partial
   *     entry and a real recovery cost, whereas a complete box is hedged by construction and the
   *     post-fill economics gate already unwinds one that turned out uneconomic. The degradation is
   *     still recorded on the attempt's diagnostics, so it is never silently discarded.
   *
   * A callback that THROWS has told us nothing, and nothing is not permission — but it is also not
   * proof of incoherence, and failing an ENTRY closed on a diagnostic bug would be its own defect.
   * A throw is therefore treated as an explicit objection, matching `stillWantedSafely`.
