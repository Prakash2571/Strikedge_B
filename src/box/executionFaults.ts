/**
 * TECHNICAL FAULTS ARE NOT MARKET OUTCOMES.
 *
 * The parent-entry path used to collapse every thrown error into one label:
 *
 *     catch (err) { console.warn(...); finish("FAILED", "internal_error", ...) }
 *
 * so the dashboard could tell you that something broke 47 times and nothing else. A Mongo
 * outage, a missing live order manager, a durable-reservation authority failure and a genuine
 * programming bug were one indistinguishable bucket.
 *
 * The opposite mistake is just as bad: exposing `error.message` as the metric label. Exception
 * text is unbounded and attacker/market influenced, so it would turn a counter into an unbounded
 * label space — the classic cardinality explosion — and leak candidate keys and symbols into
 * telemetry.
 *
 * So this module defines a SMALL FIXED taxonomy (ten classes, closed set, `as const`), modelled
 * on the existing `REJECT_CLASSES` in `executionOutcomes.ts`, plus a bounded diagnostic log that
 * keeps the detail a human needs without ever becoming a metric label.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS ENFORCES
 * A programming error must NEVER be disguised as `edge_disappeared`, a liquidity rejection or a
 * fees rejection. Those are market outcomes and they are how the strategy is judged. A technical
 * fault is a technical fault, and it belongs in its own vocabulary.
