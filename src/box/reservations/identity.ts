/**
 * WHO OWNS A RESERVATION — a globally unique, opaque owner identity.
 *
 * WHY A SEQUENCE NUMBER IS NOT ENOUGH
 * The coordinator used to mint `entry-7-lx9f2k` from a per-process counter. Inside
 * one process that is unique. Across two PM2 workers it is not: worker-1's
 * `entry-7` and worker-2's `entry-7` are the same string, so worker-2 could
 * "renew" — or worse, RELEASE — worker-1's lease, and a durable store keyed on that
 * identity would happily let it. Owner identity has to be unique across every
 * process that shares the database, or owner-verified release is verifying nothing.
 *
 * SHAPE
 *   <deployment>:<instance>:p<pid>:<boot>:<kind>-<seq>:<uuid>
 *   production-mumbai:calspread-1:p38192:m8x2a:entry-7:9f2c1e...
 *
 * Every component earns its place:
 *   deployment  namespaces staging away from production in a shared cluster
 *   instance    names the host/replica, so a log line says which box it was
 *   pid         distinguishes PM2 cluster workers on one host
 *   boot        distinguishes a RESTARTED process that reused the same pid
 *   kind-seq    human-readable correlation with the coordinator's own logs
 *   uuid        makes collision impossible rather than merely unlikely
 *
 * The uuid alone would be sufficient for uniqueness. The rest is there because an
 * operator reading a conflict log needs to know WHICH worker is holding a contract,
 * and a bare uuid tells them nothing.
 *
 * OPAQUE, AND NO SECRETS
 * Owner ids reach logs, metrics labels and (via diagnostics) an admin API response.
 * They are therefore built only from a configured deployment label, a hostname, a
 * pid and random bytes. No token, no URI, no credential — and `deployment` is
 * validated to a conservative character set so a mistyped env var carrying something
 * sensitive cannot be smuggled through it.
