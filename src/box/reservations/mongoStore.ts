/**
 * THE MONGO ADAPTER — the durable correctness authority.
 *
 * COLLECTION `box_instrument_reservations`
 *   _id          the globally unique owner id (so owner lookup is a primary-key hit,
 *                and owner uniqueness is enforced by the database rather than hoped for)
 *   deployment   lock namespace: production / staging / development
 *   broker       zerodha | dhan
 *   generation   broker generation this reservation was taken under
 *   keys         the COMPLETE instrument set, as an array
 *   fence        monotonic fencing token
 *   expires_at   authority-clock expiry
 *
 * INDEXES, AND WHY EACH EXISTS
 *   1. `{ deployment: 1, keys: 1 }` UNIQUE  ← the entire safety property.
 *      `keys` is an array, so this is a MULTIKEY index: Mongo writes one index entry
 *      per element. A unique constraint applies across documents, so no
 *      `(deployment, key)` pair can exist in two documents. That is literally "no
 *      contract is held by two live reservations". Only one array field appears in the
 *      compound key, which is the documented requirement for a compound multikey index.
 *      Scoping by `deployment` is what keeps a developer's laptop from contending with
 *      production in a shared cluster.
 *
 *   2. `{ expires_at: 1 }` with `expireAfterSeconds: 0` ← GARBAGE COLLECTION ONLY.
 *      Mongo's TTL monitor runs roughly once a minute, so a document routinely
 *      outlives its expiry. NOTHING in the algorithm depends on this index: expiry is
 *      decided logically from the stored timestamp (see `durable.ts`). This index only
 *      stops abandoned rows accumulating forever.
 *
 *   3. `{ deployment: 1, broker: 1, generation: 1 }` ← operator queries and
 *      generation-scoped housekeeping.
 *
 * `autoIndex` IS EXPLICITLY DISABLED.
 * Leaving index creation to Mongoose's `autoIndex` would mean the unique constraint
 * that provides the whole atomicity guarantee might silently not exist — most likely
 * in production, where `autoIndex` is exactly what people turn off. So indexes are
 * created deliberately in `ensureReady()` and then READ BACK AND VERIFIED. If the
 * unique index is absent or not actually unique, this adapter refuses to become ready,
 * and live Box entry fails closed rather than running without the protection it thinks
 * it has.
 *
 * TIME COMES FROM THE SERVER.
 * `serverTimeMs()` performs an aggregation-pipeline update that stamps `$$NOW` onto a
 * bookkeeping document and reads it back. `$$NOW` is the server's clock and is
 * identical for every member of the deployment, so every worker derives expiry from
 * ONE clock and worker-to-worker skew cannot cause two owners. A pipeline update is
 * used rather than the `hello` admin command because it needs only the write access
 * this collection already requires — no admin privilege, which some managed tiers
 * restrict.
