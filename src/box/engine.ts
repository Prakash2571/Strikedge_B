/**
 * The box engine: the one object that owns the module's lifecycle.
 *
 * It wires the shared market-data feed to the scanner and the position monitor,
 * maintains the ATM±3 strike windows and their subscriptions, executes through
 * one mode-neutral gateway, persists fills, and publishes state to the UI.
 *
 * Two independent switches:
 *
 *   DISCOVERY  (RUN / STOP)  — opening NEW boxes.
 *   MONITORING (always on)   — managing and exiting boxes that are already open.
 *
 * STOP only turns discovery off. Positions never become unmanaged.

   *
   * WHY DELETION IS NOT "CLOSE WITH EXTRA STEPS"
   * A close is a market event: it produces fills, realises P&L and belongs in the
   * day's history. A delete is an ADMINISTRATIVE correction: the trade should never
   * have counted at all. So nothing about it may survive in any statistic, in any
   * of the four places box state lives (in-process memory, Redis, Mongo, and the
   * P&L archive) — and the numbers must be RECOMPUTED, not adjusted.
   *
   * WHY LIVE TRADES ARE REFUSED
   * A live box may have real broker exposure attached. Deleting the record would
   * orphan it: the position would still exist at the broker with nothing in our
   * database pointing at it, so no reconciliation, no monitor and no flatten could
   * ever find it again. An open live trade must be flattened first. A CLOSED live
   * trade is retained too, deliberately — it is the audit record of real money
   * moving, and `deleteBoxTrade`'s query guard refuses both cases.
   *
   * Returns a `{ ok, code, error }` result in the same shape as `closeManually`, so
   * the route surfaces it with `res.status(result.code)` exactly as it already does.
