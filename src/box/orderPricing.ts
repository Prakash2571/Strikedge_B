/**
 * EXECUTABLE ORDER PRICING — the marketable-limit model, depth walking and the
 * conservative queue approximation.
 *
 * Every function here is PURE: no clock, no randomness, no I/O. Given the same
 * book and the same configuration it returns the same fills, byte for byte. That
 * determinism is load-bearing — the whole point of a paper simulator is that a
 * recorded market always reproduces the same result.
 *
 * THREE IDEAS
 *
 * 1. MARKETABLE LIMIT (not a market order). An order is priced against a REFERENCE
 *    touch and carries a LIMIT a bounded number of ticks past it. The book may be
 *    walked only down to that limit; anything worse is refused. This is the
 *    difference between "I'll pay up to ₹100.10" and "I'll pay whatever is
 *    showing" — real arbitrage execution is the former.
 *
 *       BUY : limit = reference + chaseTicks × tick   (willing to pay UP TO)
 *       SELL: limit = reference − chaseTicks × tick   (willing to sell DOWN TO)
 *
 * 2. DEPTH WALKING. A marketable-limit order fills across as many book levels as
 *    it needs, stopping at the limit. The average fill price is the
 *    quantity-weighted mean of the slices it took.
 *
 * 3. CONSERVATIVE QUEUE APPROXIMATION. We cannot see NSE order-level queue
 *    priority from level-2 depth, so we do NOT pretend the displayed quantity is
 *    all ours. With the "haircut" model only a configurable fraction of each
 *    displayed level is treated as executable for us. This is a transparent,
 *    deterministic stand-in — NOT a reconstruction of true queue position — and it
 *    is recorded (displayed vs effective) so a paper run can compare raw and
 *    conservative liquidity. Randomness is never used.

/**
 * MARKETABLE vs PASSIVE classification, decided from an OBSERVED book rather than from an

 *
 * WHY THE DISTINCTION IS LOAD-BEARING (audit divergence D20)
 *
 * A marketable limit crosses the spread: it executes against liquidity that is visible to us
 * right now, so its fill behaviour is largely a function of things we CAN measure — displayed
 * depth within the limit, and how fast we arrive. A passive limit rests behind other orders at
 * its price, so whether and when it fills is dominated by true NSE queue position and by other
 * participants' flow, NEITHER of which a retail level-2 feed reveals.
 *
 * That means the two have fundamentally different epistemic status. Statistics about marketable
 * fills are evidence; statistics about passive fills are largely a statement about an unobserved
 * queue. Pooling them produces a "fill rate" that flatters passive orders, slanders marketable
 * ones, and describes neither — which is why every distribution and every parity comparison in
 * this system is keyed by the profile this function returns.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no randomness.
