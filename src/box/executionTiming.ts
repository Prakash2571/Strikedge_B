/**
 * LIVE EXECUTION TIMING — the instrumentation that turns real broker operations into
 * calibration evidence.
 *
 * WHY (audit divergence D1)
 *
 * `brokerTimingStore.ts` was already written, already tested, and already documented as wired.
 * It was not wired: nothing in `src/` ever constructed it or called `recordLegTiming`. Not one
 * of the eleven timestamps it wants was captured anywhere on the live path. So the whole
 * calibration story — paper learning from what the account actually experienced — had no
 * source of truth at its root.
 *
 * This module is that source. It sits between the live order path and the two sinks
 * ({@link BrokerTimingStore} for rolling per-broker distributions, and
 * {@link ExecutionCalibrationStore} for the dimensioned distributions paper consumes), and it
 * collects one {@link OrderTimingTrace} per order.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE RULE THAT OVERRIDES EVERYTHING ELSE: FAIL-OPEN
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This code runs inside the live order path, including inside the protective-cancel and
 * emergency-unwind paths. If it can throw, it can prevent a cancel. If it can block, it can
 * delay one. Either would turn an observability feature into a way to lose money.
 *
 * Therefore:
 *
 *  - EVERY public method is individually wrapped. Nothing here can propagate an exception, not
 *    even an out-of-memory-adjacent failure in a sink.
 *  - Nothing here awaits, performs I/O, or touches Mongo/Redis/the network. Marks are two
 *    numbers written into a small object.
 *  - Failures are COUNTED and exposed ({@link ExecutionTimingRecorder.diagnostics}), never
 *    silently swallowed and never papered over with a substitute sample. A missing measurement
 *    is reported as missing; a fabricated one would corrupt the calibration it feeds.
 *  - The trace map is bounded, so a leak in the caller cannot become a leak here.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * MONOTONIC FOR MEASUREMENT, WALL CLOCK FOR AUDIT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every mark captures both (see {@link ../executionClock}). Spans are computed exclusively from
 * the monotonic readings; the wall clock is used only for the audit trail, for freshness and
 * for time-of-day bucketing. They are never mixed in one subtraction.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ISOLATION
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A trace carries its broker, operation kind, purpose and order profile, and the sinks file it
 * under exactly those dimensions. Zerodha and Dhan samples cannot meet; ENTRY and
 * PROTECTIVE_CANCEL samples cannot meet; marketable and passive samples cannot meet. Nothing in
 * this module pools anything.
