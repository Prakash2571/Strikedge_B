/**
 * The LOCAL, deterministic, synchronous option-charge calculator.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Box qualification used to wait on Zerodha's virtual contract note
 * (POST /charges/orders) before it could decide whether an opportunity was still
 * worth taking. That put a network round trip — tens to hundreds of milliseconds
 * — between seeing a four-leg mispricing and acting on it, which is exactly the
 * window in which such a mispricing disappears.
 *
 * So the decision path now uses this module: no I/O, no promises, no caching
 * needed, a few dozen floating-point operations. Zerodha is still consulted, but
 * AFTERWARDS, to verify the arithmetic (see chargeReconciler.ts). A paper fill is
 * never delayed by it.
 *
 * SEMANTICS ARE COPIED, NOT INVENTED
 *
 * The output shape and the rounding rules are taken from the calendar engine's
 * existing `toLegCharges` / `aggregateCharges` in src/index.ts, so a locally
 * calculated contract note is interchangeable with a Zerodha-priced one:
 *
 *   - every head is rounded to paise individually
 *   - a leg's `total` is the sum of its ROUNDED heads (so heads always add up)
 *   - a group's heads are the sums of the legs' rounded heads
 *   - `value` is quantity x fill price (premium turnover)
 *   - `stt_type` is Kite's label, "stt" for equity derivatives
 *
 * RATES
 *
 * The rates are NOT hardcoded in the trading logic: they live in one place here
 * and every one is env-overridable, because statutory rates change. The shipped
 * defaults are the current NSE equity-OPTIONS structure:
 *
 *   brokerage           ₹20 per executed order (Zerodha F&O)
 *   STT                 0.15% of premium, SELL side only
 *   exchange txn        0.035530% of premium (NSE equity options), both sides
 *   SEBI turnover       0.0001% of premium (₹10 per crore), both sides
 *   stamp duty          0.003% of premium, BUY side only
 *   GST                 18% of (brokerage + exchange txn + SEBI)
 *   NSE IPFT            0 by default — see BOX_IPFT_PCT below
 *
 * Sources for the defaults (rates are summarized, not quoted):
 *   https://support.zerodha.com/category/account-opening/resident-individual/ri-charges/articles/exchange-transaction-charges
 *   https://support.zerodha.com/category/account-opening/company-partnership-and-huf-account-opening/company/articles/charges-society-account
 *   https://www.kotakneo.com/uploads/FATAX_73524_49fff471f4.pdf  (STT on option sales)
 *
 * If a rate changes, or if the reconciler starts reporting a consistent
 * discrepancy, ONE env var fixes it for the whole module — and until it is fixed
 * the discrepancy is visible in /api/box/status rather than silently mispricing
 * every trade.
