/**
 * Box arbitrage module — the single entry point index.ts talks to.
 *
 * The whole module is wired by dependency injection so it can reuse the
 * application's broker session, shared WebSocket, instrument cache and charge
 * estimator WITHOUT index.ts having to export its internals or the box code
 * having to import from it (which would be a circular import).
 *
 * BROKER NEUTRALITY
 * This file is the seam. `registerBoxModule` still accepts the concrete
 * `KiteClient` that index.ts owns, but it ADAPTS it into the broker-neutral
 * `BoxMarketDataProvider` / `BoxMarginProvider` / `BoxLiveAdapterFactory` that
 * BoxEngine consumes (see brokerContext.ts). The engine therefore cannot name a
 * venue, and a second broker is wired by supplying different implementations of
 * those three interfaces rather than by touching the strategy.
 *
 * Paper execution remains the default. Live broker access is constructed only
 * behind the independent execution-mode and live-trading gates; all broker
 * mutations then pass through the durable central order manager.
