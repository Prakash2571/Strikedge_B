/**
 * ONE ACTIVE BOX PER UNDERLYING — an OPTIONAL, additional entry restriction.
 *
 * WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 *
 * The existing reservation layer locks EXACT CONTRACTS, which is precisely right for
 * preventing two executions from racing the same option. It deliberately does NOT prevent
 * two Boxes on the same underlying at different strikes — `RELIANCE 2500/2600` and
 * `RELIANCE 2550/2650` share no contract, so both may run concurrently today, and a test
 * (MP5) pins that as intended behaviour.
 *
 * Concurrent same-underlying Boxes are not an execution-safety problem; they are an
 * ACCOUNTING and RISK-ATTRIBUTION problem. Two Boxes on one underlying can hold opposite
 * option roles that economically offset each other, so the broker's net position per
 * contract no longer decomposes cleanly into "Box A's exposure" and "Box B's exposure".
 * Reconciliation, partial-exit accounting and residual attribution all become materially
 * harder to reason about at exactly the moment they matter most.
 *
 * So this module adds a SECOND, coarser layer, off by default:
 *
 *   Layer 1 (this module) — an underlying-level ENTRY restriction.
 *   Layer 2 (unchanged)   — the existing exact-contract durable reservation.
 *
 * Layer 2 is NOT replaced, weakened or bypassed. With the restriction disabled, behaviour is
 * byte-for-byte what it was.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE CENTRAL DESIGN DECISION: A TTL LEASE MUST NEVER REPRESENT AN OPEN POSITION
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The naive implementation takes a lease on `UNDERLYING:RELIANCE` for the duration of the
 * entry and releases it when the entry function returns. That is WRONG in both directions:
 *
 *   - Release on return ⇒ the lock vanishes while a Box is still OPEN, so a second
 *     RELIANCE Box enters immediately. The restriction would not restrict.
 *   - Hold until TTL ⇒ the lock is a lease with an expiry, so a long-held position outlives
 *     its own lock, and a crashed process' open position stops blocking after the TTL.
 *
 * Neither a lease nor durable state alone is sufficient, so this module composes BOTH and
 * blocks on the UNION:
 *
 *   Layer 1a — DURABLE POSITION OWNERSHIP. Derived from persisted Box state: open Boxes,
 *              partially-exited Boxes, RECOVERY Boxes, unresolved residual exposure, and
 *              unresolved order intents. It has no expiry, is reconstructed at boot from
 *              Mongo, and is authoritative for "a Box is live on this underlying".
 *
 *   Layer 1b — ENTRY PIPELINE OWNERSHIP. A short TTL lease in the existing durable
 *              reservation store, covering only the window between admission and the
 *              moment durable state exists. It exists solely to make the check
 *              cross-process safe; an in-process `Set` cannot do this job when live runs in
 *              more than one process.
 *
 * The lease may safely be released as soon as the entry settles, BECAUSE by then Layer 1a
 * has taken over. That is what makes the lock neither lost while a position is open nor
 * incorrectly retained once the position is fully flat: the two layers hand off, and
 * "fully flat" is defined by the same `isBoxPositionFlat` predicate the rest of the engine
 * uses. Both properties are pinned by tests.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * EXIT IMMUNITY
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is an ENTRY restriction and nothing else. It is never consulted for an EXIT, a
 * PROTECTIVE_CANCEL, an EMERGENCY_RESIDUAL flatten, or a reconciliation-driven reduction.
 * Reducing exposure we already own must never be blocked by a gate whose purpose is to
 * limit how much new exposure we take on.
 *
 * Everything in this module is PURE. It performs no I/O, holds no state and reads no clock;
 * the caller supplies already-loaded state and owns the reservation store.

/**
 * The underlying lock expressed as a leg reference, so it can ride in the SAME reservation

 *
 * WHY REUSE THE EXISTING DOCUMENT rather than build a second reservation namespace: one
 * document holds the complete key set behind a unique multikey `{deployment, keys}` index, so
 * adding the underlying key makes it participate in the identical ALL-OR-NONE atomic claim. It
 * inherits — with no new code and no new failure mode — the fencing token, the broker
 * generation filter, the deployment namespace, the TTL and crash recovery, the renewal
 * heartbeat, and the Mongo compare-and-set. A parallel namespace would have to re-earn every
 * one of those properties, and its acquisition could not be atomic with the contract keys.
 *
 * `side` is deliberately CONSTANT. The underlying lock is direction-agnostic: any two Boxes on
 * one underlying conflict, whatever sides their legs take. A constant side makes every such
 * pair classify as same-side, which is exactly the intended "serialise or refuse".
 *
 * `token: 0` and the `UNDERLYING` pseudo-exchange are never used to identify an instrument —
 * only the `key` matters to the reservation tiers, which treat keys as opaque strings.
