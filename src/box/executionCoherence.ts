/**
 * FOUR-LEG BOOK COHERENCE — the ONE shared admission decision.
 *
 * A box is four independent order books. Trading it as a single economic object
 * is only justified when those four books are, as far as we can evidence, a
 * COHERENT cross-sectional snapshot: each fresh on its own, and observed close
 * enough together that they plausibly describe the same market instant.
 *
 * Before this module the dispersion limit was enforced in EXACTLY ONE place — the
 * paper simulator (`executionSimulator.ts`) — and the LIVE gateway
 * (`executionGateway.ts`) never consulted it. The consequence was concrete: the
 * live path admitted four books spread 8,000 ms apart because each individual
 * quote age stayed under the 15,000 ms per-leg allowance, even though a 250 ms
 * cross-leg exchange-dispersion limit was configured. Per-leg freshness cannot
 * see cross-leg skew; only a cross-sectional gate can. So the gate now lives HERE,
 * in one pure function, and BOTH paths call it. They cannot drift because there is
 * only one decision to drift from.
 *
 * ── WHAT RECEIVE-TIME DISPERSION DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE ────────────────────────
 *
 * Receive-time is when OUR process saw each packet. Low receive-time dispersion
 * proves the four packets ARRIVED close together — it bounds how stale any leg can
 * be relative to the others in wall-clock terms we actually control. It does NOT
 * prove the exchange PUBLISHED the four books at the same instant: a burst of
 * queued packets can arrive together yet describe books the exchange stamped
 * seconds apart, and network jitter can spread genuinely simultaneous books. So
 * receive-time is a necessary, self-controllable liveness bound, not a proof of
 * simultaneity.
 *
 * Exchange-time dispersion is closer to the real question — but only as good as
 * the broker's timestamp semantics and precision allow (see BROKER_TIMESTAMP_NOTES
 * below). It is used as an ADMISSION CONSTRAINT when every leg carries a usable
 * exchange timestamp, and never fabricated when one does not.
 *
 * PURE and SIDE-EFFECT-FREE: it measures and decides; it never mutates state,
 * never emits metrics, never places an order. Callers own those.

/**
 * WHAT EACH BROKER'S "EXCHANGE TIMESTAMP" ACTUALLY IS — verified 2026-09-09.
 *
 * Zerodha Kite Connect v3 (WebSocket streaming, full mode)
 *   Source: https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/websocket/
 *   The `full` packet carries an "Exchange timestamp" at bytes 60-64 as an int32.
 *   It is EPOCH SECONDS, so its granularity is ONE SECOND (1000 ms). Two books the
 *   exchange published 400 ms apart can carry the SAME whole-second stamp, and two
 *   it published 1 ms either side of a second boundary can carry stamps a full
 *   second apart. Any exchange-dispersion threshold below ~1000 ms is therefore
 *   unsatisfiable-by-noise for Kite data and would reject coherent books purely on
 *   quantisation. `quote`/`ltp` modes carry NO exchange timestamp at all.
 *
 * DhanHQ v2 (live market feed)
 *   Source: https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/live-market-feed/
 *   NEITHER the Quote packet NOR the Full packet (the one that carries 5-level
 *   market depth) contains a depth-publication timestamp. The only time field is
 *   "Last Trade Time (LTT) — EPOCH" (int32 seconds). LTT is when the instrument
 *   LAST TRADED, not when this depth snapshot was published — an illiquid leg can
 *   carry an LTT many seconds (or minutes) old while its book is currently being
 *   quoted. Substituting LTT for a book-publication time would therefore reject
 *   live, tradeable books for being "stale" when they are not, and — worse — could
 *   admit a genuinely stale book whose last trade merely happened to be recent.
 *   So Dhan supplies NO usable order-book exchange timestamp; the coherence policy
 *   must fall back to receive-time for Dhan legs and MUST NOT invent one from LTT.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE FOR THRESHOLDS: an exchange-dispersion threshold must be broker-aware
 * and never sub-second for coarse Kite stamps, and the receive-time constraint is
 * the always-available floor that carries Dhan (and mixed/missing-timestamp) cases.
