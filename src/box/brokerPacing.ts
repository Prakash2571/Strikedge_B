/**
 * BROKER-AWARE LIVE TRANSPORT PACING POLICY.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 *
 * `BOX_LIVE_BROKER_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 250ms) was a SINGLE knob applied by the
 * adapters' shared `call()` throttle to EVERY transport operation alike: order placement,
 * modification, cancellation, order-status polls, positions reads, margins and health.
 * That conflates two genuinely different things:
 *
 *   1. A REAL broker rate limit on order mutation. Exceeding it earns a 429 and, at
 *      Zerodha, counts the rejected request against the daily order-request budget. This
 *      is a hard external constraint and must be honoured.
 *
 *   2. A POLL CADENCE we chose ourselves. How often we re-read a working order's status
 *      is our decision, and 250ms is a sensible, deliberately unhurried choice.
 *
 * Because both used one number, making the four-leg entry burst reach the broker faster
 * would have required lowering the status-poll cadence too — spending real API budget to
 * buy submission speed. Splitting them lets the four ENTRY placements be spaced at the
 * broker's actual published placement limit while polling stays calm.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT "REMOVING A DELAY". The gap between successive placements remains a REAL
 * rate-limit wait derived from published broker limits, never zero, and never below a
 * per-broker floor. See {@link BROKER_PACING_PROFILES}.
 *
 * PUBLISHED LIMITS THE DEFAULTS ARE DERIVED FROM  (verified 2026-09-09; see docs/BROKER_LIMITS.md)
 *
 *   Zerodha / Kite Connect v3 — order placement is limited to 10 requests/second, with a
 *   further 400 orders/minute and 5000 orders/day per-user/API-key cap (across all
 *   segments and varieties), and order MODIFICATION is capped at 25 modifications per
 *   order — after which the order must be cancelled and re-placed. 10/s ⇒ a 100ms floor;
 *   the default adds 10% headroom (110ms) because the limiter is enforced on the broker's
 *   clock, not ours, and a burst that lands microseconds early is a 429.
 *   Source: https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/exceptions/#api-rate-limit
 *
 *   Dhan (DhanHQ v2) — CORRECTION OF A PRIOR DEFECT. This module previously asserted that
 *   "Dhan permits materially more than 10/s". The official DhanHQ v2 documentation states
 *   Order APIs are limited to 10 requests/second, 250/minute, 1000/hour and 7000/day, with
 *   modifications capped at 25/order. There is no headroom above 10/s to be had, so the
 *   old claim was simply wrong and is removed. The repository's own `src/brokers/dhan/http.ts`
 *   additionally paces every HTTP call at `DHAN_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 120ms); 120ms is
 *   ABOVE the 100ms the 10/s limit alone would allow, so it is the binding floor here and
 *   is CONSERVATIVE with respect to the published 10/s. Source:
 *   https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/  (the "Rate Limit" table). A Dhan customer-support FAQ
 *   quotes a higher "25 orders/second, 250/minute" figure; where the developer docs and a
 *   support FAQ disagree we take the STRICTER developer-doc figure, since guessing upward
 *   is the one direction that earns a real 429 on a real order.
 *
 * MULTI-WINDOW BUDGETS. A single min-interval only bounds the PER-SECOND rate. The broker
 * also enforces per-minute, per-hour and per-day caps, and a four-leg entry every few
 * seconds can exhaust a per-minute or per-day budget long before the per-second gap ever
 * binds. {@link BrokerRateLimits} carries every published window and {@link RateBudgetLedger}
 * accounts spend against all of them, so admission can refuse an entry that WOULD fit the
 * 100ms gap but would breach the day cap — and so a reserve is always kept for recovery.
 *
 * THE NUMBERS HERE PERFORM NO I/O. The pacer and ledger take an injected clock; everything
 * else is a pure description of policy so the adapters, the diagnostics endpoint and the
 * paper live_parity scheduler all read the SAME effective numbers and cannot drift.

 * matches the deployment described in the task (one active box), but a value must be settable

 *
 * `recoveryReserveFraction` is the fraction of each window's budget that entry PLACEMENT may not
 * touch, so that protective cancels and exposure-reducing orders always have room. It applies to
 * placement only: a cancel or a modify that reduces exposure may spend into the reserve, because
