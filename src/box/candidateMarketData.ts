/**
 * CANDIDATE-SCOPED MARKET-DATA ADMISSION — the evidence for THIS box, not for the whole universe.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO FIX
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `MarketDataStateMachine.reevaluate()` reached READY only when EVERY desired instrument had fresh
 * usable depth, and the engine handed it `subscribedOptionTokens` — the ENTIRE streamed option
 * universe (every leg of every ATM±3 window across every streaming underlying, up to
 * `cfg.maxSubscribedTokens`). READY is the only market-data state whose permission licenses new
 * entry, so:
 *
 *     ONE illiquid strike in an unrelated underlying that never ticks
 *       ⇒ everyDesiredFresh() === false
 *       ⇒ state SYNCHRONIZING/DEGRADED, never READY
 *       ⇒ executionGateway checkpoint 1 refuses EVERY box with `feed_unhealthy`
 *
 * A four-leg NIFTY box whose own four books were all fresh, executable and same-generation was
 * refused because of a BANKNIFTY strike it does not touch. The refusal message even claimed
 * "entry requires fresh usable depth per leg" — the intent was already per-leg; the implementation
 * was universe-wide.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE THREE CONCEPTS, NOW SEPARATE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  1. TRANSPORT / SESSION HEALTH — is the socket authenticated, live, un-backlogged, and actually
 *     delivering usable depth at all? This is a SHARED failure: when it fails, no candidate can be
 *     trusted no matter how fresh its cached books look, because a book observed before a socket
 *     died is not evidence about now. Owned by `MarketDataStateMachine`.
 *  2. SUBSCRIPTION / SCANNER COVERAGE — how much of the desired universe currently has fresh depth.
 *     This is an OBSERVABILITY figure (it tells an operator the scanner is running blind on N
 *     instruments). It must be reported accurately and must NOT gate entry for an unrelated
 *     candidate. Owned by `MarketDataStateMachine.coverage()`.
 *  3. CANDIDATE ENTRY EVIDENCE — do THESE four instruments each have admissible evidence right now?
 *     That is this module.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NO CACHE, DELIBERATELY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Cached candidate readiness would have to be invalidated on candidate identity, subscription
 * generation, socket generation, and every book update — i.e. on essentially every input. Rather
 * than build that and then have to prove the invalidation is complete, this evaluates from live
 * state on every call. It is four map lookups and a depth walk; the cost of getting staleness wrong
 * here is a wrong-priced four-leg box. So "invalidate cached candidate readiness when candidate
 * identity, subscription generation or evidence changes" holds by construction: there is nothing
 * cached to go stale, and a switch to a different candidate cannot inherit the previous verdict.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* PROVE — read before trusting it
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  - It does not prove the BROKER identity of a token. `BoxOptionInstrument` carries no broker
 *    field; broker identity is ambient (the active broker owns the token namespace) and is enforced
 *    by advancing the feed/socket generation on a broker switch, which invalidates every book. This
 *    module checks the generation, so a token from a superseded namespace fails — but it cannot
 *    independently attest "this integer is a Dhan security id".
 *  - It does not prove the instrument is TRADEABLE at the exchange right now (no ban-period or
 *    surveillance-suspension feed is wired). Expiry is checked; availability beyond that is not.
 *  - It does not replace `precheck()` or the four-leg coherence check. It runs BEFORE request
 *    construction, on the candidate's own instruments, and those checks still run afterwards on the
 *    built requests. This is an additional necessary condition, never a substitute.
