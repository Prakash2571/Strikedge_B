/**
 * THE EXECUTION FUNNEL — outcome counts with EXPLICIT denominators.
 *
 * The problem this exists to prevent: a "success rate" with an unstated denominator.
 * "80% fill rate" is meaningless — 80% of what? Of candidates the scanner saw? Of
 * attempts that actually reached a broker? Those differ by orders of magnitude, and
 * the flattering one is always available to quote. So every ratio published here
 * carries the numerator AND the denominator it was computed from, and the stages are
 * strictly nested so a reader can see exactly where opportunities were lost.
 *
 * THE CHAIN (each stage is a subset of the one above it):
 *
 *   candidates_evaluated          every candidate the scanner priced
 *     └─ qualified_opportunities  passed the economic gate
 *         └─ attempts_admitted    passed every admission gate (coherence, capital,
 *                                 reservation, single-lot, entry arming)
 *             └─ attempts_submitted   at least ONE real broker POST occurred
 *                 └─ four_leg_completed_entries   all four legs confirmed filled
 *
 * The gap between `attempts_admitted` and `attempts_submitted` is the zero-POST
 * refusal population (`REFUSED_BEFORE_SUBMIT`) — genuinely free refusals that cost
 * nothing. Keeping them OUT of the submitted denominator is what stops a wave of
 * cheap local refusals from diluting the real broker-facing failure rate; keeping
 * them visible as their own count is what stops them from being hidden entirely.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF SUCCESS, NEVER CONFLATED.
 *
 *   EXECUTION completion  — did the four-leg structure actually get built?
 *   ECONOMIC   outcome    — did we make money after every cost, including recovery?
 *
 * These are independent and both are published. A `FILLED_THEN_ECONOMICS_ABORT` is an
 * execution SUCCESS (all four legs filled) and an economic LOSS (round-trip spread
 * plus charges on four legs). Reporting only the first would look like a triumph;
 * reporting only the second would hide that the machinery worked. Recovery costs are
 * counted in the economic total, never excluded as "exceptional".
 *
 * PURE ACCOUNTING. This module counts what it is told and computes ratios. It never
 * decides, never rejects, never touches an order. Counters are fixed-cardinality
 * (no per-token or per-candidate labels) so the structure cannot grow unbounded.
