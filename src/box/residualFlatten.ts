/**
 * RESIDUAL-FLATTEN ATTEMPT IDENTITY.
 *
 * A residual leg is exposure we hold and did not want. The flatten loop works it every
 * `RESIDUAL_FLATTEN_MS` until the book is flat. That loop is a RETRY loop, and a retry loop
 * whose durable order identity never changes cannot retry.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO PREVENT
 * The identity used to be `stableAttemptId(attemptId, residual.created_at, role)`, and
 * `created_at` is preserved when the shrunken residual is written back — so every pass
 * regenerated the SAME `client_order_id`:
 *
 *   - filled 0 (the normal reason a residual exists): the durable intent upsert returns the
 *     existing non-CREATED intent, `OrderManager.execute()` takes its "a prior submission
 *     exists" branch, re-reads the stale order and resolves. NO ORDER IS EVER SENT AGAIN and
 *     the residual stays naked indefinitely.
 *   - filled partially: the remaining quantity changed but the identity did not, so
 *     `assertIntentImmutableMatch` throws on `quantity` — and that error matched neither branch
 *     of the old catch, so it was swallowed. Every later pass threw the same way.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT
 *   SAME logical submission  => SAME identity   (so a retry/reconcile adopts, never duplicates)
 *   NEW attempt for still-outstanding quantity => NEW identity  (so a retry can actually retry)
 *
 * HOW THE GENERATION STAYS DURABLE AND CRASH-SAFE
 * The generation lives ON the residual record (`flatten_attempt`), which is persisted by the
 * SAME `updateBoxExecutionAttemptResidual` write that persists the new remaining quantity. One
 * document write carries both, so the pair can never be torn:
 *
 *   advance + shrink        -> one atomic `$set` of `residual_exposure`
 *   crash before that write -> the generation is UNCHANGED on restart, so the next pass reuses
 *                              the same identity, and the durable intent journal (one document
 *                              per `client_order_id`) decides what that means: a `CREATED`
 *                              intent is submitted (no POST had happened), anything later is
 *                              adopted through `adapter.getOrder`. Never a duplicate order.
 *   crash after that write  -> the previous generation reached an outcome that explicitly permits
 *                              advancement: COMPLETE/CANCELLED broker truth left a remainder, or
 *                              a local refusal proved no POST. Broker-origin REJECTED deliberately
 *                              retains its identity for operator/reconciliation policy.
 *
 * The generation is therefore never a loose in-memory counter, never `Date.now()` and never
 * random: each attempt is represented explicitly by its own row in `box_order_intents`.
