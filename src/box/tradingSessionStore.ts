/**
 * THE DURABLE-BACKED TRADING SESSION MANAGER.
 *
 * `tradingSession.ts` holds the pure state machine and arithmetic. This module owns the
 * PERSISTENCE and the FAILURE POLICY around it, which is where the safety lives:
 *
 *   - a write failure ROLLS BACK the in-memory record, so the running counters and the durable
 *     ones can never disagree;
 *   - a READ failure at boot is NOT treated as "no session is armed" — it fails closed, because
 *     a transient Mongo error must not hand back a spent one-shot budget;
 *   - a cycle is consumed at establishment and completed at FLAT, and completions that happened
 *     while the process was down are reconciled from durable trade state at boot.
 *
 * Kept out of `engine.ts` deliberately: the engine is already very large, and a safety counter
 * whose whole purpose is to survive restarts deserves to be readable and testable on its own. The
 * persistence surface is injected, so tests drive it without Mongo.
