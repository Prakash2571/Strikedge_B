/**
 * The box scanner: the event-driven discovery and entry path.
 *
 *   Kite WebSocket → quote map → affected candidates → fast LOCAL calculation
 *   → net-profit qualification → centralized execution gateway → durable trade
 *
 * Nothing on the qualification path touches MongoDB, and nothing waits on the
 * frontend OR on Zerodha. Charges are computed synchronously by the local
 * calculator; Zerodha is consulted only afterwards, to reconcile. A tick affects
 * only the candidates that reference the token that moved.
 *
 * The scanner never calls Kite order APIs directly. Qualified candidates are
 * handed to a narrow execution gateway: paper modes delegate to the deterministic
 * simulator, while explicit live mode uses durable bounded-LIMIT coordination.
