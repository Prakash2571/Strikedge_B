/**
 * EXECUTION CALIBRATION STORE — rolling, bounded, per-dimension distributions of REAL
 * observed live execution latency, plus the honesty machinery that decides whether paper is
 * allowed to use them.
 *
 * WHY (audit divergences D3, D19)
 *
 * Paper's arrival timing was a single constant, `BOX_SIMULATED_LATENCY_MS=250`, forever.
 * A constant is wrong in a specific and damaging way: it has no tail. Real broker latency has
 * a long right tail, and the tail is exactly where a four-leg arbitrage dies — the leg that
 * arrives 900 ms late is the one that finds the book gone. A simulator with no tail
 * systematically overstates fill rates.
 *
 * The fix is not to invent a tail. It is to MEASURE one and feed it back. This store is where
 * measured live samples accumulate, and the thing it is most careful about is refusing to be
 * used before it has earned it.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS, AND WHY EACH ONE IS SEPARATE
 *
 *   broker   — Zerodha and Dhan are different companies, different networks, different
 *              matching-engine gateways. Pooling them describes neither. NEVER mixed.
 *   region   — a deployment in ap-south-1 and one in us-east-1 have different physical RTTs.
 *              Held per store, and a store never merges samples from another region.
 *   kind     — ENTRY / EXIT / UNWIND / CANCEL / MODIFY. Cancel latency is not entry latency.
 *   profile  — MARKETABLE_LIMIT vs PASSIVE_LIMIT. See latencyModel: passive behaviour depends
 *              on unknowable queue position, so its statistics must never contaminate the
 *              marketable ones the strategy actually relies on.
 *   bucket   — OPEN / NORMAL / CLOSE. Used ONLY when the bucket has enough samples of its own.
 *   stage    — the eight separately-measurable spans of one order's life.
 *
 * FRESHNESS AND SESSIONS (Phase 24)
 *
 * Yesterday's latency is not today's. Samples carry an IST session key, and
 * {@link ExecutionCalibrationStore.resolve} counts only samples from sessions inside the
 * configured freshness window when deciding what paper may use. Older samples are RETAINED —
 * they are useful for analytics and for spotting drift — but they are excluded from active
 * calibration rather than silently ageing into it.
 *
 * THE HONESTY CONTRACT
 *
 * {@link ResolvedCalibration.measured} is the single most important field in this module. It is
 * false whenever the returned numbers are a configured fallback rather than live observations.
 * Nothing downstream may present `measured: false` figures as measured latency, and
 * `confidence` is forced to LOW in that case. A fallback is always explained in `note`.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE
 *
 *  - `record()` is O(1): one map lookup and one ring-buffer write. No allocation beyond the
 *    first sample for a key, no sorting, no I/O. It is safe to call per broker operation.
 *  - `resolve()` and `snapshot()` sort copies to compute percentiles and are COLD PATH ONLY.
 *  - Every distribution is a fixed-capacity ring; memory is constant regardless of uptime.
 *  - Keys are bounded by construction: brokers × kinds × profiles × buckets × stages.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN. `record()` never throws. Calibration is observability; it may degrade, but it may
 * never interfere with an order.
