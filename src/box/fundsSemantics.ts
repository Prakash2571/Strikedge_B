/**
 * WHAT A BROKER'S "AVAILABLE FUNDS" FIGURE ACTUALLY MEANS — and why guessing is a funding bug.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The stage-funding model needs two numbers: how much the account can spend, and how much is
 * already encumbered by other orders and positions. Both brokers expose a funds endpoint with an
 * "available" and a "utilised" figure — but whether `available` is ALREADY NET of `utilised`
 * determines the arithmetic completely, and getting it wrong is a real money bug in one direction:
 *
 *   available is NET, and we subtract utilised anyway
 *     ⇒ we UNDERSTATE spendable funds ⇒ we refuse entries we could afford.
 *     Annoying, visible, and SAFE.
 *
 *   available is GROSS, and we do not subtract utilised
 *     ⇒ we OVERSTATE spendable funds ⇒ we admit an entry the account cannot fund
 *     ⇒ the broker rejects a leg mid-sequence ⇒ partially-executed exposure to recover from.
 *     DANGEROUS.
 *
 * The two errors are not symmetric, so the default when the semantics are not established must be
 * the understating one. That is what `unverified` does here, and it says so in the refusal text so
 * an operator knows precisely which fact to go and confirm rather than being left with an
 * unexplained refusal.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS IS A DECLARED TABLE AND NOT AN INLINE `-` OPERATOR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Determine whether broker-reported available funds are already net of encumbrances" is a
 * per-broker documentary fact with a verification date and a source, not a coding preference. Held
 * as data, it can be cited, reviewed, re-verified when a broker changes its API, and — critically —
 * carry an honest `unverified` value instead of an assumption dressed as arithmetic.

 *   Zerodha's own published description of the Kite funds view is that the available margin figure is
 *   the amount usable to place new trades, and that it already reflects premium received, realised
 *   and unrealised P&L and collateral benefits. A figure defined as "what you can use to place new
 *   trades" is by definition net of what is already blocked, so `utilised.debits` is a corroborating
 *   observation and must NOT be subtracted again.

 *   Consulted 2026-09-13. Content paraphrased for licensing compliance.
 *   RESIDUAL RISK: this is the vendor's SUPPORT documentation for the Kite funds screen, not a field-
 *   by-field statement in the API reference (which could not be retrieved in this environment). The
 *   mapping from the screen's "available margin" to the API's `available.live_balance` is a reasonable
 *   but not vendor-confirmed identification, and remains NOT VERIFIED against a live account.
 *
 * DHAN — `unverified`.
 *   The adapter reads `availabelBalance` (the vendor's own spelling) and `utilizedAmount` from the
 *   fund-limit endpoint. The v2 funds documentation describes the endpoint as returning available
 *   funds together with margin requirements, but the field-level statement of whether
 *   `availabelBalance` is already reduced by `utilizedAmount` could not be retrieved here, and the
 *   endpoint also exposes `withdrawableBalance` and `blockedPayoutAmount`, which are further distinct
 *   notions of "available". Rather than pick one, this stays `unverified`: the conservative
 *   understating interpretation is applied and every refusal names the unverified semantics.
 *   Source: https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/funds/ — consulted 2026-09-13 (index/summary only; the field
 *   table was not retrievable).
 *   TO RESOLVE: read the fund-limit response for the real account with a known open position and
 *   confirm whether `availabelBalance + utilizedAmount` equals the pre-trade figure. That is a
 *   deployed read-only check (Gate B), not something code can settle.
