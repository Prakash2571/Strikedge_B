 *      uses exactly the same memory as one that just started. An unbounded array
 *      of latency samples is a memory leak with a graph attached.
 *   2. Recording is O(1) and allocation-free. These calls sit on the hot path, so

 * Percentiles are computed only when somebody ASKS (i.e. /api/box/status), where
