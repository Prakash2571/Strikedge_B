/**
 * The in-memory book of open box positions.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *
 *  1. Keep the open positions out of the hot path. The monitor re-prices every
 *     open box several times a second; doing that from Mongo would be absurd, so
 *     the authoritative live view lives here and the database is written only on
 *     entry, on exit, and on a slow periodic snapshot.
 *
 *  2. Enforce ONE OPEN BOX PER EXACT STRIKE PAIR. `reserve()` is synchronous, so
 *     two ticks arriving in the same turn of the event loop cannot both begin an
 *     entry for the same box — the second gets `false` before any await happens.
 *     The unique partial index in Mongo backs this up across processes.
