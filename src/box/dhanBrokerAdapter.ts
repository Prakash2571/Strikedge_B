/**
 * Dhan live order transport, implementing the EXISTING `BrokerAdapter` interface.
 *
 * Deliberately a sibling of `kiteBrokerAdapter.ts`, not a new strategy: the same
 * `BoxOrderManager`, the same durable intents, the same bounded marketable-LIMIT
 * envelope, the same reconciliation state machine. Only the transport changes.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING RIGHT
 *
 *  1. NEVER an unrestricted MARKET order. Every request carries a bounded LIMIT
 *     envelope and `assertBoundedLimit` is enforced before anything is sent. Dhan
 *     supports MARKET orders; a four-leg box must not use them.
 *
 *  2. NEVER a blind re-submit. If POST /orders fails ambiguously (timeout, 5xx,
 *     429) the order may be live. The adapter reconciles by CORRELATION ID before
 *     concluding anything, because a second POST is how a box grows a fifth leg.
 *
 *  3. FAIL CLOSED on static IP. Dhan requires the caller's public IP to be
 *     whitelisted for order placement. When that is not satisfied the adapter
 *     refuses locally rather than discovering it mid-box.
 *
 *  4. HONEST STATE. Anything the adapter cannot prove is terminal becomes
 *     RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED, never a guessed COMPLETE or CANCELLED.
 *
 * PRODUCT TYPE is `MARGIN` — Dhan's F&O carry-forward product, the analogue of
 * Kite's `NRML`. `INTRADAY` would expose the box to auto-square-off.
