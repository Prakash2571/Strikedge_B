/**
 * Box-arbitrage domain types.
 *
 * This module is entirely SEPARATE from the calendar-spread engine: it shares
 * only the Kite client, the ticker hub, the instrument cache and the Zerodha
 * charge estimator. No calendar type, schema or collection is reused or
 * modified.
 *
 * A box on strikes K1 < K2 of the same underlying and expiry has TWO directions:
 *
 *   LONG_BOX   BUY  K1 CE / SELL K2 CE / BUY  K2 PE / SELL K1 PE
 *   SHORT_BOX  SELL K1 CE / BUY  K2 CE / SELL K2 PE / BUY  K1 PE
 *
 * Both settle at a fixed (K2 - K1) per unit whatever the underlying does: the
 * long box RECEIVES that width at expiry and the short box PAYS it. So the
 * arbitrage in either direction is the difference between the width and what the
 * four legs are actually worth right now — signed by the direction.
 *
 * BROKER IDENTITY
 * Every record the strategy writes carries the `BrokerId` that created it. The
 * field is OPTIONAL on every persisted shape so documents written before broker
 * identity existed keep loading, and `brokerOf()` resolves an absent value to
 * "zerodha" — which is a statement of fact, since Zerodha was the only broker the
 * application ever had. A record's broker is IMMUTABLE once written.
