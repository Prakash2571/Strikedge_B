/**
 * ONE-SHOT / BOUNDED-CYCLE TRADING SESSION.
 *
 * `BOX_SESSION_MAX_COMPLETED_TRADES` bounds how many COMPLETE BOX LIFECYCLES an armed
 * trading session may run:
 *
 *     0 = unlimited (the default, so existing deployments are unaffected)
 *     1 = one-shot
 *     N = N cycles
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT "ONE TRADE" MEANS
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONE COMPLETE LIFECYCLE:  ENTRY → HOLD/MONITOR → EXIT → FLAT.
 *
 * It does NOT mean "one broker order", and it emphatically does not mean "stop the engine
 * after the entry". After the single entry the engine must keep doing everything that
 * reduces or accounts for the exposure it just took on: monitoring, auto-exit, partial-exit
 * cleanup, residual flattening, reconciliation and recovery all continue untouched. Only NEW
 * ENTRY is disabled.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE TWO COUNTERS, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A single "completed" counter cannot express one-shot correctly. With max=1, the moment the
 * first Box opens its lifecycle is not yet complete, so a completed-count of 0 would still
 * permit a second entry — the exact bug the feature exists to prevent. So the session tracks
 * two append-only, idempotent sets of trade ids:
 *
 *   ESTABLISHED — a full four-leg Box was opened. A cycle is CONSUMED here.
 *                 This is what gates new entry: `consumed >= max` ⇒ no more entries, ever,
 *                 for this session.
 *
 *   COMPLETED   — that same Box later became fully FLAT. This is what makes the session
 *                 report `COMPLETED`.
 *
 * `consumed` is therefore always >= `completed`, and the gap is "cycles currently in flight".
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT MUST **NOT** CONSUME A CYCLE
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A rejected, refused, partially-filled-then-unwound, or `abort_after_fill` entry NEVER
 * establishes a Box, so it never consumes a cycle. Burning an operator's single permitted
 * trade on an attempt that ended with no position would be indefensible. Aborted attempts
 * are counted separately, for visibility only, in {@link BoxSessionRecord.aborted_attempts}.
 *
 * Note the ordering consequence this creates and which the engine must honour: a cycle is
 * recorded as established only from the SUCCESSFUL-OPEN path, after the four-leg Box is a
 * real persisted position — never from the entry-attempt path.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * RESTART SAFETY
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The record is DURABLE. A Node restart must never look like a reset, because "restart the
 * process to get another trade" would make the whole control decorative. Two mechanisms:
 *
 *   1. Boot LOADS the existing session; it never auto-arms and never zeroes a counter.
 *   2. {@link reconcileCompletions} closes cycles that went flat while the process was down,
 *      by re-reading durable trade state for every established-but-not-completed id. So a
 *      completion cannot be lost either.
 *
 * A counter is only ever reset by an explicit operator arm/reset, and {@link canArm} refuses
 * even that while a consumed cycle still has live exposure — otherwise re-arming would be a
 * one-click bypass of the very limit that was configured.
 *
 * This module is PURE. It owns no I/O and no clock; the caller supplies `now` and persists
 * the record through its own store.
