/**
 * BACKEND INSTANCE IDENTITY — how a client orders readiness decisions ACROSS a restart.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFECT THIS FIXES
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The readiness decision carries `decision_generation`, incremented once per decision by
 * `private readinessDecisionGeneration = 0`. It is PROCESS-LOCAL. The frontend accepts a decision
 * only when its generation is strictly greater than the one already rendered — correct for ordering
 * concurrent responses from one process, and completely wrong across a restart:
 *
 *     browser has rendered generation 5000
 *     backend restarts; its counter resets; it publishes generation 1
 *     5000 > 1  ⇒  the browser rejects 1, and 2, and 3, … indefinitely
 *
 * The dashboard then shows a permission verdict from a process that no longer exists, and keeps
 * showing "entry permitted" long after the new process has decided otherwise. Only a manual reload
 * clears it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ORDERING PROTOCOL, AND WHY IT WORKS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A decision is ordered by the pair (`boot_ordinal`, `decision_generation`), compared
 * lexicographically, with `instance_id` used only to tell whether we are still talking to the same
 * process:
 *
 *   same instance_id      → order by decision_generation (strictly increasing). Unchanged behaviour;
 *                           this is what already fixed out-of-order concurrent responses.
 *   higher boot_ordinal   → a genuinely NEWER process. ADOPT it and rebase the sequence, so a
 *                           restart is picked up without a manual refresh.
 *   lower boot_ordinal    → a delayed response from a process we have already superseded. REJECT.
 *   equal ordinal, different instance_id
 *                         → two processes claim the same epoch, which the single-instance topology
 *                           forbids. INCOMPATIBLE: refuse, and disable new entry with that reason,
 *                           rather than interleaving two processes' verdicts.
 *   ordinal missing (null)
 *                         → UNORDERABLE. Never allowed to overwrite an ordered decision, and
 *                           reported as incompatible so new entry is disabled.
 *
 * WHY AN ORDINAL RATHER THAN A RANDOM ID. A random per-boot identifier tells a client the instance
 * CHANGED but not which one is NEWER. A client would then have to either trust any unfamiliar id —
 * in which case a delayed response from the OLD process gets adopted as new, the same bug pointing
 * the other way — or trust none, which is where we started. Ordering requires an order.
 *
 * WHY NOT A CLOCK. Wall clocks cannot carry this: an NTP step, a VM snapshot restore, or a container
 * booting with a skewed clock each produce an "older" instance that looks newer. Correctness here
 * depends on no clock at all.
 *
 * WHY POSTGRESQL. It is already the operational authority in this system, and
 * `UPDATE … SET last_ordinal = last_ordinal + 1 RETURNING last_ordinal` is atomic, so two concurrent
 * boots receive DISTINCT ordinals and neither can observe the other's value. Minting the ordinal from
 * the same authority that orders everything else is what makes "newer" mean something.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED WHEN THE AUTHORITY IS ABSENT. If PG cannot be reached at boot the ordinal is null and
 * the decision is unorderable, which disables new entry. That is the correct reading rather than an
 * inconvenience: a backend that cannot reach its authoritative store must not be authorising new
 * exposure, and the engine independently refuses entry in that state for the same reason.
