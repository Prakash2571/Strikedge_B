/**
 * DETERMINISTIC PAPER SCHEDULER — reproduces the live BoxOrderManager scheduling.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * Under `live` mode the four leg orders of a Box are all handed to `BoxOrderManager`
 * at once (`Promise.allSettled(requests.map(manager.submit))`), but the manager does NOT
 * run them in parallel. It admits them through a priority queue, one per free concurrency
 * slot, and — because a live adapter holds its slot across the ENTIRE order lifecycle
 * (submit → broker ACK → poll-to-terminal) — a `maxConcurrentExecutions = 1` deployment
 * serialises whole lifecycles, not just the HTTP POSTs. On top of that every transport
 * call is paced by `BOX_LIVE_BROKER_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` on the adapter's shared throttle.
 *
 * The previous paper `live_parity` released all four legs at the same instant (each with
 * its own latency draw) and only capped whole *pipelines*. That is the single biggest
 * remaining scheduling-parity gap. This module closes it by computing, from the SAME
 * policy the live manager uses ({@link ExecutionSchedulingPolicy}), the exact order and
 * timing in which each operation would acquire a slot, be paced onto the wire, be
 * acknowledged, and free its slot.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 *
 * A pure planner: given a set of operations (each with a purpose → priority, a FIFO
 * sequence, a ready time, and its per-stage latency components) and the policy, it
 * returns a fully-resolved timeline per operation. No clock, no I/O, no randomness — the
 * same inputs always produce the same schedule, which is what lets the golden fixtures
 * pin it and a Go port reproduce it byte-for-byte.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 *  - It does not decide FILLS. Whether/when a resting LIMIT order fills is decided later,
 *    from actual observed WebSocket books, by the leg executor. This planner only decides
 *    WHEN the order is live at the exchange (its ACK) and how long its slot is held.
 *  - It does not model each individual poll GET's pacing during the rest window. The POST
 *    is the pacing-relevant transport event that gates other operations; polls happen
 *    inside an operation's own already-held slot. This is a documented simplification, not
 *    an invented behaviour — but note it is an OPTIMISTIC one: live pays the shared throttle
 *    for every status poll of every working order, so with a concurrency cap above 1 paper
 *    will under-estimate how long a POST waits for the wire.
 *  - It does not INVENT a durable-persistence delay. `persistenceMs` defaults to 0, so a run
 *    that has never measured the live Mongo round trip is knowingly optimistic on that stage
 *    rather than guessing at it. Once measured, the caller supplies the real value.

/**
 * Plan the full schedule for a batch of operations under the given policy.
 *
 * The algorithm is a faithful discrete-event model of the live manager:
 *
 *   - Up to `maxConcurrentOperations` slots may be occupied at once. A slot is occupied
 *     from an operation's `dequeued_at` until its `terminal_at` (whole lifecycle), because
 *     the live adapter's `submitOrder` does not resolve until the order is terminal.
 *   - Whenever a slot is free, the WAITING operation with the best (lowest) priority, then
 *     the lowest sequence, is admitted — exactly the manager's `sortQueue` order. This is
 *     re-evaluated at every slot-free event, so a higher-priority operation that became
 *     ready while a slot was busy correctly jumps ahead of an already-queued lower one.
 *   - The POST is paced by `minBrokerIntervalMs` on a single shared transport channel, so
 *     even when two slots run concurrently their POSTs are spaced apart, just as the
 *     adapter's shared `call()` throttle enforces.
 *
 * Returns one {@link ScheduledOperation} per input, in input order.
