/**
 * THE HEDGE COVERAGE LEDGER — proven, attributed, single-use evidence that an uncovered SELL is
 * safe to transmit.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. The hedge-first barrier (see orderManager.ts) used to authorise a
 * dependent SELL on the basis of "no BUY hedge of this attempt was recorded as a DEFINITIVE
 * FAILURE" — i.e. `hedgeFailure === null`. That is a FAILURE signal, not a COVERAGE signal, and the
 * two are not complements. A BUY hedge that came back CANCELLED with ZERO fills, or OPEN, or
 * PARTIALLY_FILLED-then-terminal below its required size, or in any terminal state that the
 * failure classifier did not name, left `hedgeFailure === null` — and the full-size uncovered SELL
 * that depended on it was authorised and POSTed NAKED. Confirmed against current main: with both
 * BUY hedges returning CANCELLED/0-filled the gateway still transmitted both SELL legs at entry
 * concurrency 1 and 4.
 *
 * THE INVERSION. Permission for a dependent SELL now requires PROVEN SUFFICIENT COVERAGE, not the
 * absence of a named failure:
 *
 *   • Coverage is only ever created by an authoritative broker snapshot whose FILLED QUANTITY
 *     reaches the required size. A broker acceptance, an order id, an ACK, an OPEN/working state,
 *     or a state the classifier merely failed to name is NOT coverage — it is the absence of
 *     coverage, and the absence of coverage is not permission.
 *   • The snapshot must MATCH the intended hedge on every attributable axis: attempt identity,
 *     role, contract (token AND tradingsymbol), side (a hedge is a BUY), broker/account, and
 *     requested quantity. A fill on the wrong contract, the wrong side, the wrong account or a
 *     different attempt covers nothing.
 *   • Attribution is SINGLE-USE and ATTEMPT-SCOPED. One proven hedge fill can back the dependents
 *     of exactly the attempt it belongs to; it can never be reused across incompatible attempts.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED. Absent, stale, mismatched or unprovable evidence yields NO coverage. Every method
 * here is a positive assertion ("this much is proven"); the DEFAULT is zero.
 *
 * SCOPE — ENTRY ONLY. This ledger exists solely to decide whether it is safe to CREATE the
 * uncovered short half of a box. It is never consulted for an EXIT, a PROTECTIVE_CANCEL or an
 * EMERGENCY_RESIDUAL: those reduce exposure already owned, and coverage is irrelevant to reducing
 * risk. The order manager enforces that by only building coverage for `purpose === "ENTRY"`.
 *
 * PURE STATE, NO I/O. This is in-memory session authority, exactly like the transport gate it
 * lives beside. It is never written to the durable intent and never sent to a broker.
