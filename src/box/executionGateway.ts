   *   4. Ages each observation on the MONOTONIC clock, so an NTP step cannot fabricate or erase
   *      staleness, while retaining wall time for the audit record.
   *   5. Re-reads the identity and invalidates evidence acquired for a different

/**
 * Project the settled entry into the authoritative per-role outcomes the recovery plan needs.
 *
 * A role with NO order snapshot was not submitted, or was refused before any POST. That is safe
 * to report as `submitted: false` — and NOT as unknown — only because the caller has already
 * quarantined every ambiguous case: `ordersFromSettled` surfaces an order for an ambiguous submit
 * and for a persistence-after-fill, and the `uncertain` check refuses to continue when any such
 * order is present. So by construction, a missing snapshot here means "no exposure was created",
 * while a present one is terminal with a broker-confirmed cumulative quantity.
 *
 * ON TERMINALITY, and why it is NOT `isBrokerOrderTerminal(order.state)`.
 *
 * By the time `manager.submit` resolves, the adapter has already driven the order to a settled
 * outcome — polling to a terminal state and, on timeout, protectively cancelling and CONFIRMING
 * the final cumulative quantity. An order it could not settle surfaces as `UNKNOWN` or
 * `RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED`, which the caller has already quarantined.
 *
 * So a `PARTIALLY_FILLED` snapshot arriving here is not "still working": it is a settled partial
 * whose `filled_quantity` is the authoritative final quantity. Gating the unwind on the lifecycle
 * enum instead of on PROVABILITY would refuse to reverse exactly those confirmed partial fills and
 * strand them as naked exposure. Both fields are therefore derived from the single question that
 * actually matters — is the quantity provable? — which is what the pre-existing code trusted.
