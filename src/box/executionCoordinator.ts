/**
 * BOX EXECUTION COORDINATION — one contract, one execution at a time, ACROSS WORKERS.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM, CONCRETELY
 * Every duplicate guard in this engine is keyed on the strike pair
 * (`underlying|expiry|K1|K2|DIRECTION`). A 1300/1320 box and a 1320/1340 box are
 * therefore treated as unrelated, even though both trade the 1320 strike. Nothing
 * stopped them submitting in the same instant, each assuming the FULL displayed size
 * resting at 1320. Real closed-trade history shows exactly that: overlapping-strike
 * pairs opened in the same second. In paper it overstates achievable fills, because
 * the same resting lot is spent twice.
 *
 * That guard used to be process-local. Under PM2 cluster mode, several workers, two
 * EC2 instances or Kubernetes replicas, each process owned a separate in-memory Map:
 * both saw RELIANCE 2550CE as free, both reserved it, both sent an order. The
 * reservation store is now CHAINED — a free in-process filter in front of a durable
 * MongoDB authority — so exclusion holds deployment-wide. See
 * `reservations/durable.ts` for why a single-document insert against a unique
 * multikey index makes a four-leg claim atomic.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SITS, AND WHY THERE
 * It decorates `BoxExecutionGateway` — the interface where, and only where, the
 * paper/live branch happens. That placement is the whole design:
 *
 *   scanner / monitor  ->  THIS  ->  CentralBoxExecutionGateway  ->  paper | live
 *
 * so paper gets no shortcut around coordination. Paper realism is the reason to
 * insist on that: a simulator that lets two boxes consume one lot is not modelling
 * anything real. It also means the scanner and monitor need no changes at all, and
 * none of this lands in the already-oversized engine.ts.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SLEEP
 * A fixed `await sleep(250)` before every second execution would be both wrong and
 * slow: wrong because it does not actually establish exclusion, and slow because the
 * dislocation is usually gone. The loser of a conflict instead registers for the
 * winner's release and is woken by it — typically within a millisecond — then
 * REPRICES against the current book before it is allowed to proceed.
 *
 * WAITING IS NOW HYBRID, BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE
 * `onRelease` is an in-memory emitter: it can only ever observe a release by THIS
 * process. A contract held by a sibling worker will never fire it. So the wait races
 * the release event against a short jittered timer and retries the acquisition —
 * event-driven where that works, bounded polling where it cannot. The jitter matters:
 * without it several workers freed by the same release would retry in lockstep and
 * hammer the authority in a thundering herd. Every path stays bounded by
 * `BOX_CONFLICT_WAIT_MAX_MS`; there are no unbounded waits.
 *
 * TTL IS NOT EXECUTION PERMISSION
 * The dangerous sequence is: this worker stalls on GC, its lease expires, another
 * worker legitimately takes the contracts, this worker wakes up and submits another
 * leg. Local state saying "running" is not good enough. So ownership is re-checked
 * at every point where it can be:
 *
 *   • a heartbeat RENEWS the lease and, on failure, records a safety event and trips
 *     `invariantViolation` rather than carrying on;
 *   • `stillWanted` — which the simulator already consults before each leg — is
 *     COMPOSED with a synchronous ownership predicate, so ownership loss aborts the
 *     remaining legs of a paper legging run through the existing abort path;
 *   • immediately before delegating, the broker generation is re-checked, and the
 *     durable lease is re-verified whenever the execution waited.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * It does not serialise unrelated boxes. Two boxes sharing no contract never wait on
 * each other; there is no global execution mutex and no per-underlying lock —
 * RELIANCE 2500CE and RELIANCE 2800CE are independent. And it does not net opposite
 * sides internally: that needs the ledger to represent virtual ownership of both
 * boxes while broker net exposure is zero, which has not been proven, so the safe
 * path (serialise, confirm, re-evaluate) is taken for both same-side and
 * opposite-side overlaps.
