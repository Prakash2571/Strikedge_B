/**
 * Contract-note charge shapes, lifted verbatim out of the CalSpread `src/db.ts`.
 *
 * They live here — with no database dependency at all — because the Box core
 * declares its own structural copies in `src/box/types.ts` and a compile-time
 * assertion in `src/box/model.ts` proves the two stay interchangeable. In
 * CalSpread these interfaces happened to sit next to the Mongoose models; in
 * StrikeEdge there are no Mongoose models, so the types get their own module.
 *
 * NOTHING here is persistence. `ITradeCharges.at` is a `Date` exactly as before,
 * so a charge payload produced by the shared Zerodha estimator round-trips
 * through the PostgreSQL JSONB audit columns unchanged.
